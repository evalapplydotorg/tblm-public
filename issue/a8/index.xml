carefully, and they are still trying to
go deeper into your warm flesh-
I am sorry, dear, but I don’t know if
I can remove all of them without
spilling any more blood than what
already runs off the valleys of your back.
I have shot at your belly so you
can never bear any children,
and bullets are all you can digest now-</description></item><item><title>The Biggest Enemy of Rain – by Manu Bhattathiri</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p494/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 11:40:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p494/</guid><description>Contrary to popular belief, the biggest enemy of rain is not the rapid felling of trees. Nor is it rising global temperatures, industrialization, the burning of fossil fuels or even that telltale hole in the sky. The single biggest enemy of rain is a person by the name of Gopi and he still lives in our little town and he still hates rain.
We would sit on a parapet by a small creek, a group of us younger old men and Gopi, who was old enough to be reborn a toddler.</description></item></channel></rss>
