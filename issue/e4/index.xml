This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and
the receipts of the past. I wish
for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the
blurred edges of time. I am asked
to let go, so instead I sit at the ledge
with a hand dangling outside, collecting rain for warmer days, when perhaps</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Ajay Kumar Nair</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1294/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:46:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1294/</guid><description>touchscream
diwali outside, &amp;amp; names smoke on my tongue
with the taste of burning diyas / in the TV’s
glitching glow the blue chips packet is passed
around, the remote has a coat of masala magic

watch the single tick split into two, then turn

when she flutters to the lone,
warm bulb that stutters
in the nondescript nook of our house,
possibly looking for faith the way we do.
If she does find it fumbling in trepid waters
that are first bitter and soon engulfing like most
unfamiliar emotions, we may think she is where
we are, at the brink of realizing that we are not</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Michael Lauchlan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1285/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:28:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1285/</guid><description>The Shape of the Known Universe

After Sirens
triage and questions, a stretcher
and the littoral cadences of emergency.
Voices, soft and sharp, whisk
between a young man’s
lacerations and an old woman
drowsing under a grey bob
on a cart in a corridor while
her husband shifts weight</description></item><item><title>Collateral Damage – by Suchitra Sukumar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1283/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:25:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1283/</guid><description>I didn’t fear Radhika until I had fallen in love with her. Our first years together were all sex and electric conversation. She was in her goth phase then, her eyes lined with kohl that shone like hot tar, and she wore dark maroon lipstick. “Oxblood,” she said when I asked her what it was called. “Rad… won’t you wear pink once in a while?” She rolled her eyes.
Oh, how I craved her!</description></item><item><title>Grin and Bear It – by Neha Negi</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:07:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</guid><description>The arctic waves lap over me, freezing the blood in my veins. Shame ushers in a memory of shame. The snapping strap of my bathing suit – shame – my incipient breast sliding out – it grips me – the horror and the shame. Shame is a hirsute monster lurking in the depths; slaying it was my salvation.
