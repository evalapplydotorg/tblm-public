<p>Turmeric
My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</p>

<p>There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?</p>

<p>Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</p>

<p>First Person
I’m sure I initially saw you, the mandrill,
in a children’s illustrated photographic book or
possibly in a National Geographic pictorial and
I always think the same thing about your cream teeth and
Union Jack black red and blue mask
I always think the same thing
you are beautiful you are terrifying
I think, all hail the surreal primate troll
I think, the mammal clown with garish smeared soft</p>

<p>The colors are vivid. Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature. I couldn’t decline.</p>
