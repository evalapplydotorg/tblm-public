**
Some emails
are more difficult
to receive
from a child
long out of college
the daughter who writes
her cancer is back
but the doctor says
with chemo and surgery
things should be fine
and all the while
the father wonders
why she didn’t call
at midnight and let
the telephone scream
hysterically in the night
to deliver the news
a computer is too
cold a messenger</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</guid><description>Varanasi, December 2014
You unwelcomed me with fog
on a blinding night
hurrying into history
like the feet of your ghaats
As I crawl up
the rickety slope
of your refrigerated afternoon
I am spiral and backward
in time’s forsaken bedroom
where chaste Hindi adulterates
several slips of tongues
and the languid orality of people
mulls over suicidal lungs
You rise at sundown
by the Ganges
You bathe, you shiver</description></item></channel></rss>
