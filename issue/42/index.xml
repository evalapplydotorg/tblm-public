It seems to capture so much about what this collection is about: girls and women, connection to the (literal, muddy) earth, the speed and sudden shifts in life’s trajectories. It’s also about a specific person, a teacher, and the effect he had on these girls.</description></item><item><title>Three prose poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p958/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 03:49:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p958/</guid><description>Living a dog’s life
On the day of Divasi amavasya, Amma breaks a thumri on the transistor, fetches some fresh mud near the tulsi plant with a girl child’s innocence. She makes two idols — Shiva and Parvati — faceless, crude, even genderless. She empties a bowl of coconut oil on my head, saying that my head is hot, and scrubs it with shikakai she has brought all the way from Bangalore.</description></item></channel></rss>
