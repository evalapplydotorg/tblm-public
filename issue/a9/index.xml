There is one tubelight in the hall
and the windows, whose glasses
are either broken or sold off,
give away more than they should.
I am studying the adjective clause
but can’t find one to describe my father.
What is it that he will blame my mother for tonight
before thrashing her against the wall?
I taper through the scissors of possibilities.
A private fear frosts my mind.</description></item><item><title>Sharanya Manivannan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p522/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 15:42:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p522/</guid><description>Barring a couple of stories, the protagonists in your stories can be said to be in stasis. They end where they begin; or if there is a change, it serves only to make them more conscious of their conflicts, paradoxes. Thought of from a technical viewpoint, stasis is the enemy of plot. What are your views on this thing called plot? How comfortable are you with it, and will we ever see you write a traditionally—for want of a better word—plotted work?</description></item><item><title>On Lighting Up</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p520/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 14:54:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p520/</guid><description>That day, we watched Patchaikili Muthucharam, studying the contours of Sarathkumar’s triceps, while he exclaimed all the while semma body I’m telling you it’s aatukaal soup with extra blood. I had no frame of reference; the only blood I sought was sparse every month and irrevocably stained the satin underwear I bought at the export store in Pondicherry. When I had gone to buy them, the saleswomen giggled uncontrollably and adjusted their dupattas when I told them to let him into the trial room.</description></item></channel></rss>
