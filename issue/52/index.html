<div>How to know that you’re new to New York
The mailman is your friend now. His wife and you both practice yoga. She’s into hot yoga, you’re following the Iyengar school. He, the mailman and you are both happy about this conversation.
Or when you see skeletons of trees and realize that all the branches are a series of multiple “Y”s and you glue a “Y” to every thought that crosses your mind.</div>

<div>Beauty in stillness, evinced by dead flowers
in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,
with slurries, and piss, dour hiking trips to the ravine.
Man on the bridge: You’re not welcome here.
Bring immigration papers—he glowered from the ravine.
Suspicion begets suspicions for truth
seekers. Be on time for coffee hour at the ravine.
The Sufi crunches halves of maple leaf jalebi.</div>

<div>Once upon a routine death,
February snow wears a cold night
in its cataracted eyes, and sets out to meet
fellow occupants of fresh obituaries in stale newspapers.
Obituaries
That seek asylum from winter drought
in lost samovars of salted tea served with warm butter
at funerals of young militants to thirsty mourners.
Thirsty mourners
sit across each other in saffron tents
and lay bets on the average velocity of new guns</div>

<div>If my clothes get torn, I mend them
If soiled, I wash them
If I find no clothes
I will walk nude like you, Akka, but
How do I wash the dirt on a dress not worn?
If my sandal’s straps come undone, I’ll repair them
Left with a single shoe, will put it away
I could even cross the thorny, stony paths barefoot, but
If the path begins to devour the feet, Akka</div>

<div>Crenulated by ancient toil this
wall of sand stands against
the sky and stretches. At night it
turns homely: restaurants light
up its alleys. We get drunk on
its shrunken size and our
escape from the guide’s
intoning of its history.
Especially
the slave chambers, ferret
holes in which they were
shoved, stacked and sold –
on which Khiva thrived
for centuries. The cages
aren’t empty but thick
with pleading eyes</div>

<div>Sunday
Sunlight and anxiolytic flora
drink themselves silly;
an eastern pinch of sky blurts
like it forgot to take its pills.
The worm has wept
all Sunday while you were
reading the newspaper.
Of watering the taste of a fleck
of midnight fruit between your teeth.
Of the hummingbird, disturbed
by the sound of hideous undressing,
again leaving the portrait
of uncut happiness
unfinished in the whorl.
Mist rises toward</div>

<div>Have you ever tried
to slip out of your skin?
Not in the way
that means sad girls
and nights of warped mirrors
shoulders shrugging into themselves—
this is not a poem about my body.
Can a poem secede from
the hands that write it?
I am welded to myself,
to my ones and zeros and chipping
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—
of stepping out of flesh
without anything hanging</div>

<div>The tea cup has broken
in the shape of your lip –
the way people break
when nudged by grief.
The ink has spilled near the pocket
in the shape of a territory –
the stain stays –
the way an occupier does.
The paperback has dog eared
around the edges –
the way Time arrives
as a wave.
The mirror has splintered
into fragments –
the way autumnal leaves crunch</div>

<div>Puro was about to leave for the fields when she said to Jangir, “Will you come with me? I’ll give you laddoos to eat.”
Jangir had been playing with a soapnut in the lane. He swept up the soapnut, put it in his pocket and set off with Puro.
Puro was a young jat girl who danced the giddha and who, while playing on the swing, always soared higher than anyone else.</div>
