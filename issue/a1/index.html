<p>It came down to a slip of paper, an official form: A-354. If André had been a clochard, a homeless bum, it wouldn’t have mattered. Paris’ so-called free spirits, as liberated as any dog (except those they leash around), were notorious for not caring for regulation. Freezing on a slab of sidewalk in winter they’d accept a cup of soup but nothing that entailed the dreaded red tape. André wasn’t a clochard, just down at the heels, down on his luck, down but not out.</p>

<p>**I (or The End Of Life)
**
You talk sad.
I talk expensive.
Potato tart appetisers
are rare. Baby shrimp are rare.
But you dog!
It is true.
I am hungry.
Goodbye my waiter!
It is closing time.
**II (or It Is The Nature of The Weightless To Soar)
**
Inside I am blue.
You are invisible within.
For those watching
you are an elegant dinosaur
I am a blue whale</p>

I always loved math, but was terrible at it. Even now, when I see cars coming towards me, it reminds me of these feelings and how I am glad I have them, and then sorry to have them, and then happy, and how there are two cars coming towards me, then three, now four, and I am fifty four, then five years old, then six, then seven, and soon eight, and there is one sun in the sky, it’s so beautiful, and then zero.</p>
