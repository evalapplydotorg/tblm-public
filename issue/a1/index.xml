If André had been a clochard, a homeless bum, it wouldn’t have mattered. Paris’ so-called free spirits, as liberated as any dog (except those they leash around), were notorious for not caring for regulation.

You talk sad.
I talk expensive.
Potato tart appetisers

I am a blue whale</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Ricky Garni</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p269/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:40:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p269/</guid><description>**ADDING AND SUBTRACTING

I always loved math, but was terrible at it. Even now, when I see cars coming towards me, it reminds me of these feelings and how I am glad I have them, and then sorry to have them, and then happy, and how there are two cars coming towards me, then three, now four, and I am fifty four, then five years old, then six, then seven, and soon eight, and there is one sun in the sky, it’s so beautiful, and then zero.</description></item></channel></rss>
