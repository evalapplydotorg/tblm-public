Last night, after they fought, he sawed off a pop bottle and smoked too much.\n“Give me some,” Kristine says, as he takes a rattling pull."},{"href":"https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/09/p93/","title":"Exile","author":"Gabriel Valjan","issue":"3","category":"fiction","date":"09 Sep 2013","year":"2013","month":"2013/09","summary":"Exile was first published in Issue 17 of \u0026gt;kill author.\n**For my namesake\n**\nEl desterrado es ese tipo de persona que ha perdido a su amante y busca en cada rostro nuevo el rostro querido y, siempre autoengañándose, piensa que lo ha encontrado.\nThe exile is the type of person who, having lost the Beloved, keeps searching for the face he loves in every new face and, forever deceiving himself, thinks he has found it."},{"href":"https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/09/p87/","title":"Gasoline","author":"Jen Knox","issue":"3","category":"fiction","date":"09 Sep 2013","year":"2013","month":"2013/09","summary":"My TV, computer and spare cash left with Laura. She’d visited her favorite shoe store with my Visa and used the back of the receipt to write a Dear Jude note. Her handwriting was precise. It explained that she would be moving to Arkansas to live with Gustav, some guy she met online, and would never be back.

After a seven hour flight from Tokyo, preceded by an eleven hour flight to Tokyo. My breath was stale and my deodorant had long since given up.
