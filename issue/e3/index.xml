“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:14:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</guid><description>Petaled Geography
We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us
each morning. Orange, a song
which they will teach us. Mexico
on a thick stalk. In late fall,</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1253/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:09:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1253/</guid><description>How does one speak of love
amnesia is an attic full of salvation,
a tainted spine brewing soft waters into memory.
you speak a language recently forgotten,
of sentences reeking of mason jars and tombstones;
weaving a sister tongue of lost identity
I often wonder if you remember how warm figs taste like, or the scent of sour raisins staining your shoulder,
If it were up to me, I would kiss words into your mouth, breath them with silken tenderness and tuck them behind your teeth so you never have to sing a lullaby of wounded silence.</description></item><item><title>The Sanskari Bahu</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1251/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1251/</guid><description>is first of all not a person with any
edges. She has a strong middle but her
boundaries are mostly fluid. She must
accommodate. At first, she is expected only
to be pretty. A grandmother-in-law
remarks you must rouge your cheeks when
the ladies of the neighborhood arrive.
Then
and then she must begin to give. Give of her
sleep a few carefree winks, give of her bath
a few thoughtful scrubs, give of her tea a few</description></item><item><title>Threading My Eyebrows in New Orleans</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1248/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:26:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1248/</guid><description>She plucked and weeded me
like her private garden.
Tending to me
like a page from her Koran,
or like the kantha my foremothers stitched.
Nine minutes of complete attention.
Every stem, every root, every bend.
She bends on me like a lover, a mother, a devotee.
Stretching? she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,
we are collaborators, co-gardeners and florists, all in one.</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1242/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:19:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1242/</guid><description>The Pianist
Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.</description></item></channel></rss>
