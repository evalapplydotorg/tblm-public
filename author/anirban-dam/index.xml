My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1050/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:12:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1050/</guid><description>Erosion

Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle. Time and again, this table has witnessed the unbecoming of a story, or a moment becoming untraceable—you leaning against the wall, exhaling portions of nostalgia as the window tries to fathom every possible shape of departure.</description></item></channel></rss>
