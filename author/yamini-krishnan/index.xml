to slip out of your skin?
Not in the way
that means sad girls
and nights of warped mirrors
shoulders shrugging into themselves—
this is not a poem about my body.

to my ones and zeros and chipping
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—
of stepping out of flesh
without anything hanging</description></item></channel></rss>
