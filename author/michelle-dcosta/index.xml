_
***
Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow
her and say, in English, I miss the Arab
fisherman from Marina beach terribly.
The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish

at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.

to the market, she sighs,
her finger still pointing.</description></item><item><title>The Help – by Michelle D’Costa</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</guid><description>She aroused interest in Bradley like a sealed envelope could do.
He was dumb but not deaf and she did not know that.
