There is one tubelight in the hall
and the windows, whose glasses
are either broken or sold off,
give away more than they should.
I am studying the adjective clause
but can’t find one to describe my father.
What is it that he will blame my mother for tonight
before thrashing her against the wall?
I taper through the scissors of possibilities.
A private fear frosts my mind.</description></item><item><title>Lost Rickshaws</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/02/p412/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:47:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/02/p412/</guid><description>She says nothing, and how.
The radio plays a dirge
for December. Then when walking
was going from verse to worse
in the hay of our years, she infiltrated
the moonlight in my beers. My toothpaste
wasted on her charcoal lips.
The things I could do were few
and the things I couldn’t fewer.
The drugged street lamps; the lost
rickshaws in their long slumber. Now
she extends herself like a theorem</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</guid><description>Varanasi, December 2014
You unwelcomed me with fog
on a blinding night
hurrying into history
like the feet of your ghaats
As I crawl up
the rickety slope
of your refrigerated afternoon
I am spiral and backward
in time’s forsaken bedroom
where chaste Hindi adulterates
several slips of tongues
and the languid orality of people
mulls over suicidal lungs
You rise at sundown
by the Ganges
You bathe, you shiver</description></item></channel></rss>
