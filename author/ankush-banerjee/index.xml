On their last night together,
he finds her naked on the
bed, his right hand on her chest, the left slowly probing what he is convinced is
the grand canyon
of betrayal. For most, love comes in shape of a flute. Or a birthmark resembling forgiveness. She is a black piano standing beneath a waterfall.
Weary of the futility of grief,
she pulls him close.
A train passes at a distance.</description></item></channel></rss>
