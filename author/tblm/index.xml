We are interested in the Word and all its possibilities. We are known to take chances and push towards new aesthetics, new sensibilities, and new voices. In our archives spanning the last 8 years, you will find the work of established writers and prize winners alongside important emerging voices.
In order to emphasize the personal, intimate relationship with language, our magazine is deliberately minimal.</description></item><item><title>Submit</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/submit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 09:34:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/submit/</guid><description>We welcome submissions in poetry and fiction from around the world.
