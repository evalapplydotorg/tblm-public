On the day of Divasi amavasya, Amma breaks a thumri on the transistor, fetches some fresh mud near the tulsi plant with a girl child’s innocence.

Konnichiwa you say in an uneasy whisper
language has abandoned your fingertips, alienated you,
your poems now merely mirror the mirage of colors, of shoes and booths,</description></item></channel></rss>
