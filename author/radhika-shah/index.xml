(A reflection of Zubair Ahmed’s poem of the same name)
Sometimes during quiet summer
afternoons when everyone is
asleep, I sit at your desk.
They took away your half
of the bunk-bed anyway.
Aai still calls your name
in our empty house
and Papa sits very still.
I think he pretends
not to be listening for you.
Sometimes I will look down
and imagine I am you instead</description></item></channel></rss>
