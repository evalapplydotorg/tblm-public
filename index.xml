My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</description></item><item><title>Universe on a Banana Leaf</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 05:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</guid><description>There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium

the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:56:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</guid><description>Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</guid><description>First Person

Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood.

Our first years together were all sex and electric conversation.

Shame ushers in a memory of shame. The snapping strap of my bathing suit – shame – my incipient breast sliding out – it grips me – the horror and the shame.

“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:14:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</guid><description>Petaled Geography
We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.

Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored

so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us

amnesia is an attic full of salvation,

Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word

alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 01:34:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</guid><description>How to know that you’re new to New York

in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,

Black spiders in my woodpile
asterisk a sharp distinction
between their brisk compaction
and the expansive human view.
These spiders aren’t the toxic
species that gleam in cellars
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.
They’re only shy little blobs
dedicated to devouring gnats.

The Library of Olan

The intention was to smoke out
those who refused to leave

To fill the library with tears,
interrupt their exile with words,
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,

a drowning man sips
when he is finally free
of the echo of the sea.
This is how you move.
Like spoken-word poems
that carry the finality
of the written word in
their voices.
Break, break, break.
It wasn’t meant to be.</description></item><item><title>Postmortem</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:21:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</guid><description>Postmortem
Listen: imagine your
body next to mine.
Think of the knife
that drew my thin spine
open. I am in a room
so cold and lonely
like the slow negative
of a stone breaking
into water. One evening
I asked you how to die
this slow: smooth, bent
along the edges of my grave.
Almost losing my way back home.

no one leaves home unless

—Warsen Shire
Home is an arrested metaphor

The princess is nagging
The frog to sing
Before a kiss
“Are you kidding me” he says
I have nothing for nose
Nothing like an Adams apple
Saying this, he spits on her face
And she turns into a cricket
Burdened with a broken violin
Together they are now the greatest
Band of the night in swamps
He is croaking notes while she
Rubs her hairy legs

Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle.

On their last night together,
he finds her naked on the

For R.D: In memoriam
On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph
with their tremulous, teary smoke and sickly-sweet fragrance.
My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead
from this monsoon seascape of exile and grief.
No pearls here, not even a seashell.
His cache is bathetic: Pepsi and 7Up bottle caps,</description></item><item><title>Five Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 03:41:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</guid><description>Cabbage Moth
Mother is watching a video about raagi
flour and how to knead her way into father’s
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so
I will remember to tell him. I forget.
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk
and consistency and taste.</description></item><item><title>Buddha At The Museum</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p810/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:53:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p810/</guid><description>From a schoolgirl’s diary
On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house
where he sat in lotus position, eyes closed,
filling the circular room that was earth,
his conical head touching the arched sky.
Saturday was holiday for school. Papa would
be at his office. Mama was always absent;
she was in Dubai nursing an Arab’s girl.
On Saturdays my home was a silent cave
except for a drone rising from nowhere.</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p808/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:51:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p808/</guid><description>Salt
Mother thunders into the kitchen,
a banished witch reclaiming her place
amidst the arcane, and tips
half a jar of salt into the rice
like she tipped over the wardrobe
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been
salted beyond salvation.
It is only years later I understand the ire,
the ignominy of under-salted rice.</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p806/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:46:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p806/</guid><description>**“After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script”~

A white room with monitors
an otherworldly space in winter
I see you from the flip side
of the soundproof glass-wall;
tubes inserted from every side
screens playing an unscripted

in their yearning to remember –

Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow
her and say, in English, I miss the Arab
fisherman from Marina beach terribly.
The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish

Plantation House
Lazy heat on the veranda.
Slow crawl of days. Time ripples
like white veins through red marble.
The ceiling fan slaps a devil mask
in beating shadows. The man reads
a two-day-old Financial Times,
taps ash from a cheroot. The woman
wears a white dress and straw hat,</description></item><item><title>Another Earth</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/06/p731/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 03:07:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/06/p731/</guid><description>Distant memories approach me – I am looking in a water well, an elephant is plucking peepul leaves in the dense forest, and her mahout is laughing.
I am sprinting along narrow past-roads, fields of corns

the villages of many doors and windows.
It was my fifth grade when I saw a snake slithering in the harvested wheat field. A bare tree and its succulent drumsticks.</description></item><item><title>First Public Fighting, After Dark</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p726/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 12:03:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p726/</guid><description>i.
Almost always, I think of you fondly.
Like: clouds think of rain;
Like: words think of sentences;
Like: women think of orgasms.

But sometimes, dead
from the shoulders down
when we aggressively silently—Chomskily—
protest to one another: You’re wrong. You lie.
We wonder if others notice.
They must. Our animosity

had given up. A book

But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.

Therefore, while moving, it makes a certain creaking, drumming noise that is so common among buses in Kolkata.</description></item><item><title>The Girl Who Kissed Shah Rukh Khan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/07/p577/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 01:29:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/07/p577/</guid><description>Chances are you’ve seen my girlfriend. In that tangerine spaghetti strapped shirt. Her hand cupping the stubble on Shah Rukh Khan’s chin. Her shiny straight hair hitting the sharpness of her jaw, her lips puckered and pushed out to meet his gaunt cheeks. Shah Rukh stared back at the camera, poker-fucking straight. If you looked closely enough, you’ll see her eyelashes have too much mascara on them. Clumps of hair in black goop.</description></item><item><title>Canned Life</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/07/p571/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2017 09:55:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/07/p571/</guid><description>We stood in front of the digital display, staring at the screen space beside the number of our flight.

‘Yes?’ Avni asked me, nudging my hip with an elbow.
‘Yes.’
‘I knew it.’
‘No, you didn’t.’
‘I did. I knew something like this would happen.’
She glared at me. There was anger on her face.

About the novel (from Goodreads)
A highly charged fiction debut about a young woman in India, and the love that both shatters and transforms her. She is twenty, restless in New Delhi. Her mother has died; her father has left for Singapore. He is a few years older, just back to India from New York.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 06:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</guid><description>Isosceles Majesty
It fluttered into sight,
forming ripples
on the night’s cool surface –
a faint beacon of grey,
the outlines blending.
It settled on the doorframe,
within reach of my tiny palms,
and I caught a glimpse of a plump body
tapering to a pointy end.
It would have been
merely incongruous
without the isosceles majesty
of swept-back wings –
stiff, powder-coated, frantic,
flapping in my fumbling grasp.
I grabbed the strange creature.</description></item><item><title>Beds</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 03:52:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</guid><description>Four corners of a sheet tucked in haphazardly, little island of certainty for when the floor wobbles and the roof stares down at your eyes, a game of blink with stakes too high to forfeit – empty eggshells of unmade memories, ghost limbs curved into clammy folds, piled upon each other, want braided into need, tied with a ribbon-wisp torn off cotton sheets.
This is where screams are cushioned by pillows stuffed with dreams, where babies roll off the sides with such soft grace, tumbling over warnings, where hurt is first felt, an angry, red vision that floods nights, fevered breath and salt burning cheeks as it cuts a canyon of unsaid words, tectonic plates under lips shaking and shifting till their corners tighten a little permanently.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p528/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 07:20:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p528/</guid><description>Study Leave
There is one tubelight in the hall
and the windows, whose glasses

give away more than they should.

before thrashing her against the wall?
I taper through the scissors of possibilities.

They end where they begin; or if there is a change, it serves only to make them more conscious of their conflicts, paradoxes. Thought of from a technical viewpoint, stasis is the enemy of plot. What are your views on this thing called plot? How comfortable are you with it, and will we ever see you write a traditionally—for want of a better word—plotted work?</description></item><item><title>On Lighting Up</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p520/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Dec 2016 14:54:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p520/</guid><description>That day, we watched Patchaikili Muthucharam, studying the contours of Sarathkumar’s triceps, while he exclaimed all the while semma body I’m telling you it’s aatukaal soup with extra blood.

Ancient eateries frying jalebis and kachauris vied to generate more heat and smell than the myriad brass metal units outflanking them.</description></item><item><title>Keeping Pace</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/01/p249/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 19:10:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/01/p249/</guid><description>I was the first woman in his life, she, the most recent. Apart from him, the other thing we had in common was running. I’d finished one full and three half marathons. She was attempting her first 10k. The type of distance that becomes an accessory. She was the type of artist that makes a living out of being one. Her 10k goal was an urban layer of achievement that adds nicely to a personality.</description></item><item><title>2014: Year in Reading</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p244/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2014 05:21:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p244/</guid><description>Our contributors are our aesthetic.
TBLM did the exercise of asking its contributors to write back with a couple of their favorite books read in 2014. We basically asked for the books that really made a difference for them this year. Some responded, and voila, now we have an awesome TBR list for all you readers.

To Start With,
He closes his eyes and finds today’s date floating towards him. Shimmering in the darkness, swiveling— like the text on the Windows 95 screensaver. It seeps in through his forehead and gets absorbed. 23-04-98 is now a part of him. Today’s date, a Saturday, when the first sign of what he so eagerly awaited has appeared.</description></item><item><title>Because If Nothing Matters</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p225/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 13:43:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p225/</guid><description>It didn’t occur to me till much later that Joe had stopped coming to the library. I used to go to the British Council library regularly, and had chatted with him a couple of times. Now I had often met curious people before but he was the most eccentric among the lot. The kind that spend whole afternoons amidst stacks not because they like being surrounded by books, but because they have nowhere else to go.</description></item><item><title>Hope That He Hears</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p221/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 16:39:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p221/</guid><description>You are secretly in love with your cousin. Every vacation, in your grandmother’s house, you watch him grow a few more inches, and of late display a few more sprouts of hair. You marvel at how his voice is better than that of any boy you have heard. You also marvel at how he can sing English songs you have never heard before. Every time he touches your palm, in an attempt to teach you the right way to strike on the carrom board, you struggle to control your smile, and struggle to control the spreading of a warm, fuzzy feeling that honestly leaves you baffled.</description></item><item><title>The Tourist</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/10/p213/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 04:53:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/10/p213/</guid><description>The line outside the lunch hall was far too long- out of the weather worn tarpaulin it went, curving at oblique points of chatter and conversation, scattering into a thicket of small and smaller children, and finally into a throng of ladies all clad in starched shades of gold, green or red; men were scant, the few around the marriage hall could be seen walking about nestling half empty bottles of aquafina or nippled bottles of pale warm milk.</description></item><item><title>Fault</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/08/p208/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 12:43:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/08/p208/</guid><description>During the days we met, the rains were light. The mushrooms behind the house had weeded brown and you had said how sitting by them I looked like the boy who came out of water in a certain book you had read recently. On Fridays, you came early with a polythene packet knit gently around your wrist, dangling.

Around the time that Girish turned 16, he found that the process of mending something broken and allowing something to chime again fascinated him more than even cricket. There was something soothing about his grandfather’s painstaking ways of repairing watches and clocks. He decided to study how his grandfather repaired time pieces and the study soon turned into a hobby.</description></item><item><title>The Faraway Things</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p192/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 12:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p192/</guid><description>A Piki Tup garbage van rattles past Kero as she winces at the four-inch face of her phone. The familiar odour of rotting trash wafts into her nostrils. She frowns, looks up, curbs an urge to spit, then down again. She quickly finds her place in the text message she is re-reading. It confounds her even more. She wishes the bus would come already. With the exception of the one time she had missed it, the five o’clock bus to Highlands North had never been on time.</description></item><item><title>The Balance in Silence</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p189/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 04:25:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p189/</guid><description>I watch the tide of a new morning in the pallor of the curtains against the pane of the bedroom window. Except for the birds on the mango tree outside and an occasional vehicle that honks on the stray dogs, there is no sound.
Nothing has changed while we slept.

There was no one behind me, though in all likelihood, that was because most of the other patrons (there had been just a handful in attendance to begin with) had chosen to take the exit to the left. I do not usually watch movies at this theatre, but it was the only one in the vicinity screening this film, and because I very much wanted to watch it, I had travelled here not entirely out of choice.</description></item><item><title>The Help</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</guid><description>She aroused interest in Bradley like a sealed envelope could do.

One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of my favorite novels. Which is why, when I started reading Love in the Time of Cholera, one of the things I noticed immediately was the lack of that subtle brand of magic that I had so enjoyed. I wanted it badly and went around every corner with the expectation of a cheerful reunion. But it was not to be.</description></item><item><title>An Amorphous Voyage of Fleeting Seeds</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p152/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2014 12:53:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p152/</guid><description>Life came to us at that cusp of infinite void, the edge of the sun’s reach. It was a sudden awakening, though awakening might mean that we had been sleeping, been alive. We were never alive, both Kreetin and I.
Till the time our star-hopping vessel passed the heliosphere at the edge of solar system, we existed in not a deep slumber, but as lifeless crud. The understanding of all of humanity flashed onto us in a blinding instant, a drip bang boom of knowledge quicker than an antsy sneeze.</description></item><item><title>The Mummy’s Bitter And Melancholy Exile</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p129/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 07:29:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p129/</guid><description>_The story was first published in Cranky Literary Journal, and subsequently appeared in Lock’s newest short story collection, Love Among the Particles, published in May, 2013, by Bellevue Literary Press, New York City.

A few minutes later, the receptionist let her know that the beautician was ready. Eyebrows would be dealt with first. The beautician held the ends of the thread in her mouth and hands, forming like intent scissors.

She’d visited her favorite shoe store with my Visa and used the back of the receipt to write a Dear Jude note. Her handwriting was precise. It explained that she would be moving to Arkansas to live with Gustav, some guy she met online, and would never be back. Looking at the receipt, I wondered if the two of them planned to open a store with all the shoes six-hundred dollars had bought.</description></item><item><title>Dream of the Butterfly</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/08/p78/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2013 10:39:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/08/p78/</guid><description>I am writing this.

After a seven hour flight from Tokyo, preceded by an eleven hour flight to Tokyo. My breath was stale and my deodorant had long since given up.

This is a zen koan. I invented it. I was masturbating or was about to masturbate when I invented it. Actually, it is preposterously wrong to say I invented it. Nobody invents a koan, it just pops into your head. For more than an hour I grappled with mine, forgetting my sleepy dick, until I fell off the bed laughing so hard, so bodily, that all that was in my head got sucked up and dumped into my solar plexus like a sock into the pit of a heavy vacuum cleaner.</description></item><item><title>This Place can be Beautiful Again</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/06/p20/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 09:53:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2013/06/p20/</guid><description>I sat by the river, on a damp log half-buried in mud, and watched how the yellow finger of water wound its way through the city, past gutters and factories and underneath bridges, and it smelled like the worst thing in the world.

When Sita stole those clothes, she was sure the old woman wouldn’t know. It was a whim anyway. Sita always did things out of whims. I’m not that type. Rather, the supportive kind.

Back in the day, what seemed to bind their lives from one day to the next was the sweet spicy smell that wafted from the kitchen every morning. There was something inexplicable about it.
