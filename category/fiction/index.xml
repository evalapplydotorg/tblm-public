Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature. I couldn’t decline.</description></item><item><title>Collateral Damage – by Suchitra Sukumar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1283/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:25:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1283/</guid><description>I didn’t fear Radhika until I had fallen in love with her. Our first years together were all sex and electric conversation. She was in her goth phase then, her eyes lined with kohl that shone like hot tar, and she wore dark maroon lipstick. “Oxblood,” she said when I asked her what it was called. “Rad… won’t you wear pink once in a while?” She rolled her eyes.
Oh, how I craved her!</description></item><item><title>Grin and Bear It – by Neha Negi</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:07:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</guid><description>The arctic waves lap over me, freezing the blood in my veins. Shame ushers in a memory of shame. The snapping strap of my bathing suit – shame – my incipient breast sliding out – it grips me – the horror and the shame. Shame is a hirsute monster lurking in the depths; slaying it was my salvation.
It can be cold within these walls, painted with tears, vomit, and blood.</description></item><item><title>Yellow Laddoos – by Balwant Gargi (tr. C.

I’ll give you laddoos to eat.”
Jangir had been playing with a soapnut in the lane. He swept up the soapnut, put it in his pocket and set off with Puro.
Puro was a young jat girl who danced the giddha and who, while playing on the swing, always soared higher than anyone else.</description></item><item><title>I Learned to Fish in My Teenage Years – by Sidharth Singh</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/03/p1166/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Mar 2021 01:54:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/03/p1166/</guid><description>Back then Papa and I would hop across rocks and boulders along the Tirthan River every morning, with our fishing rods in hand—he had a sleek fly rod and I had an amateur’s spinner. He had just started me on fishing, and we did our lessons before I walked with Madhu to school.
A week had gone by and there were no wriggling trout at the end of my line; just soaking shoelaces and rags, dripping twigs and brambles, things Tirthan River wanted out of its water.</description></item><item><title>Selenology – by Apoorva Saini</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1152/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 08:19:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1152/</guid><description>“In the end, the only stories that loving you brought me were the stories of what it meant to not be loved by you.”
— Sharanya Manivannan, Conchology
That evening, the sun was slow to set, the sky cloudless, and the moon—eager. And so it loomed, amid the soft contrails left behind by the airplanes on the gentle azure sky, early and agog: that paperwhite moon. I came with my eighteen-year-old kohl-smudged eyes to see you.</description></item><item><title>Still Water – by Akhilesh</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1147/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 06:46:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1147/</guid><description>We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world

“Two more, motherfucker. And how many times do I have to ask for ice dammit?”

They have been told to gather in Narbal’s Eidgah, a huge plot of land at a stone’s throw from the Srinagar-Gulmarg highway used only for special occasions such as marriages, funerals, Eid congregational prayers and, as in this case, an assembly for listening to ‘patriotic’ sermons of high-ranking army officials while their men carried door-to-door searches in the village with the help of helpless local boys.</description></item><item><title>Bad People – by Abbas Bagasrawala</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1080/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:04:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1080/</guid><description>‘So have you ever walked in on your mother touching herself’?
I hollered through the pistachio-colored door of the bathroom as I dicky-ed around in the medicinal cabinet and in the laundry basket hoping to find something incriminatory, or personal, that might limn precious information about whether or not my friend’s mother was looking for some young gun to rock her world. I was just killing time waiting for the flush tank to refill so as to complete the double tap on it, in the manner of the British Secret Services, after what was quite an extraordinary shit.</description></item><item><title>Top Ten Mining Terms You Should Know – by Mandira Pattnaik</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p982/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 08:39:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p982/</guid><description>#10 bench: floor; usage: On the horizontal bench1050 was the muck—black mounds of illegal coal, and several pie tins clustered in one corner. All them, underground savages, crawled down to depths of upto 4000ft. in the abandoned mine, northern panhandle, Western Meghalaya, through labyrinthine passages dug with basic mining implements—shovels, hammers, pickaxes, and chisels. Its black roof and ribs—dark dungeons really—dripped water, like milk from a bovine’s udder.

“Fergof merber,” he said.
The visitor, a slim tuxedo cat, sipped from a glass, and tutted.
“You won’t last two years. This stuff is not bad at all,” said the cat, sniffing the glass’s amber contents.
“Wharg,” said Cattaparthy.
Cupping a hand to his ear, the visitor said: “Even early in the afternoon, so profound,” he said.</description></item><item><title>The Goddess Who Wants Out – by Kritika Pandey</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p976/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 08:11:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p976/</guid><description>You and I first met on a narrow hospital bed, lying side by side, astounded by the world as well as by each other. Our parents were not friends, just friendly next-door neighbors who were excited at us being born a few days apart in the same hospital. I have often wondered if they switched one baby girl for another in their excitement, if we are living each other’s lives. In our photographs from the maternity ward, we are cocooned in soft blue fabrics with a disinfected white bedsheet behind us, looking like two neelkanth birds against a cloudy afternoon sky, or, as you once put it, fake fuckin’ menstrual blood on TV.</description></item><item><title>Waiting Room – by Angana Sinha Ray</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p963/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 04:23:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p963/</guid><description>‘Do not be afraid of making mistakes on paper.’
The cursor blinks in apathy. Hot white lights; cold steel trolleys gliding across the polished marble floor in clean diagonals like a carrom board. The lobby swallows sober men infected with orderly panic. There’s a high roof but no room for talk. Some men disappear behind the revolving glass door that creaks in protest every time a person enters. The slight swirl fills the lobby up with a smell Shibani knows too well.</description></item><item><title>चेरी ब्लॉसम – अनुकृति उपाध्याय</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/09/p908/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2019 03:11:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/09/p908/</guid><description>उसने अपने कोट के बटन कंठ तक बंद किए और हथेलियाँ रगड़कर गालों पर लगाई। हज़ारों मील और दो मौसमों की दूरी कुछ घंटों में पार, धरती छोड़ी तो मुम्बई का समुद्री पवन और उतरो तो टोक्यो की हिमानी हवा।

You are all set.
Your wife may not figure out the reason for this action. You made love the night before, after the child had fallen asleep. You looked fine, familiar. She lay holding you awhile. Her head on your chest, her glowing smile, her refreshed satisfaction.</description></item><item><title>Found and Lost in Nationalism! – by Mahbub Talukder (tr.

Fairchild Fortesque chose to walk the three blocks from The Victoria Hotel to the Bull Horn Pub, and by the time he stepped into the darkness, wished to hell he’d worn his raincoat. “Who knew a drizzle would turn into a deluge?” he asked the doorman.

Later, when I told her that, she said she would have preferred to look younger, like her younger sister who people said looked at least a decade younger than her actual age.

There was always someone touching her hair, her hand, always someone telling her that it would be alright, everything would be fine, but also sobbing as they said it, while she drifted in and out of consciousness. The hospital was quiet, the nurses talked quietly.

In that tangerine spaghetti strapped shirt. Her hand cupping the stubble on Shah Rukh Khan’s chin. Her shiny straight hair hitting the sharpness of her jaw, her lips puckered and pushed out to meet his gaunt cheeks. Shah Rukh stared back at the camera, poker-fucking straight.

Fifteen years. Really?
You were only ten when she started working for your family, probably her first expat family. She had worked for local families before yours, you know. She seemed like every other nanny your parents had hired, when she worked only part-time. Only later did you start appreciating her, when she lived with you.
You have been in the company of nannies much longer than you have been with your parents, so you know you can differentiate between the good ones and the bad ones.</description></item><item><title>The Menace at the Gate – by Janet H.

Kneeling down with our hands held high in the air in the middle of the school assembly, squatting like hens with our fingers touching the lobes of our ears inside classrooms reserved for girls much younger than us, making us stand with our tongues sticking out outside the school-gate for all passersby to see; she had made us do them all.</description></item><item><title>Jeena – by Madiha Khan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/07/p338/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 06:25:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/07/p338/</guid><description>Girl came to me in a dream and a ugly mark on her chest made me weep with beauty and look at this you see there are ways in the world where brownness of skin makes a boy (ahmed) weep because he is afraid of acknowledging his own brownness even though he listens to wiz khalifa he stands alone in the kitchen at 655pm on Wednesday evening and makes fragrant thick haleem and I think of my mom wrinkling her forehead and worrying about me and then I weep and you see how weeping becomes a circle when you weep far enough?</description></item><item><title>A Perfect Pair of Feet – by Tendai Huchu</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p288/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 01:58:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p288/</guid><description>I watched Murenga sleep wearing a slight frown on his face, both hands tightly gripping the duvet, half of which lay on the floor on his side. He was a furnace and, even with the thermostat turned down, I felt the heat radiating from his sweat-soaked side of the bed. His legs were restless, twitching and kicking as though he was fleeing some horrible monster in his dreams. I couldn’t sleep, but I preferred this—me watching over him than him watching over me.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Flight – by Dimitri Keramitas</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p275/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 15:03:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p275/</guid><description>It came down to a slip of paper, an official form: A-354. If André had been a clochard, a homeless bum, it wouldn’t have mattered. Paris’ so-called free spirits, as liberated as any dog (except those they leash around), were notorious for not caring for regulation. Freezing on a slab of sidewalk in winter they’d accept a cup of soup but nothing that entailed the dreaded red tape.

The unending markets on either side of the congested roads screamed with the clamor of commerce. Motor workshops jostled easily with shops processing grain and pulses, gur and khandsari . Ancient eateries frying jalebis and kachauris vied to generate more heat and smell than the myriad brass metal units outflanking them.</description></item><item><title>Keeping Pace – by Rheea Mukherjee</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/01/p249/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 19:10:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/01/p249/</guid><description>I was the first woman in his life, she, the most recent.

I used to go to the British Council library regularly, and had chatted with him a couple of times. Now I had often met curious people before but he was the most eccentric among the lot.

Every vacation, in your grandmother’s house, you watch him grow a few more inches, and of late display a few more sprouts of hair. You marvel at how his voice is better than that of any boy you have heard. You also marvel at how he can sing English songs you have never heard before. Every time he touches your palm, in an attempt to teach you the right way to strike on the carrom board, you struggle to control your smile, and struggle to control the spreading of a warm, fuzzy feeling that honestly leaves you baffled.</description></item><item><title>The Tourist – by Aravind Jayan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/10/p213/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2014 04:53:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/10/p213/</guid><description>The line outside the lunch hall was far too long- out of the weather worn tarpaulin it went, curving at oblique points of chatter and conversation, scattering into a thicket of small and smaller children, and finally into a throng of ladies all clad in starched shades of gold, green or red; men were scant, the few around the marriage hall could be seen walking about nestling half empty bottles of aquafina or nippled bottles of pale warm milk.</description></item><item><title>Fault – by Gaurav Deka</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/08/p208/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 12:43:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/08/p208/</guid><description>During the days we met, the rains were light.

Around the time that Girish turned 16, he found that the process of mending something broken and allowing something to chime again fascinated him more than even cricket. There was something soothing about his grandfather’s painstaking ways of repairing watches and clocks. He decided to study how his grandfather repaired time pieces and the study soon turned into a hobby.</description></item><item><title>The Faraway Things – by Kushinga Kambarami</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p192/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 12:25:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/07/p192/</guid><description>A Piki Tup garbage van rattles past Kero as she winces at the four-inch face of her phone. The familiar odour of rotting trash wafts into her nostrils. She frowns, looks up, curbs an urge to spit, then down again. She quickly finds her place in the text message she is re-reading. It confounds her even more. She wishes the bus would come already.

There was no one behind me, though in all likelihood, that was because most of the other patrons (there had been just a handful in attendance to begin with) had chosen to take the exit to the left. I do not usually watch movies at this theatre, but it was the only one in the vicinity screening this film, and because I very much wanted to watch it, I had travelled here not entirely out of choice.</description></item><item><title>The Help – by Michelle D’Costa</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2014 14:40:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/04/p166/</guid><description>She aroused interest in Bradley like a sealed envelope could do.

It was a sudden awakening, though awakening might mean that we had been sleeping, been alive. We were never alive, both Kreetin and I.
Till the time our star-hopping vessel passed the heliosphere at the edge of solar system, we existed in not a deep slumber, but as lifeless crud. The understanding of all of humanity flashed onto us in a blinding instant, a drip bang boom of knowledge quicker than an antsy sneeze.</description></item><item><title>The Mummy’s Bitter And Melancholy Exile – by Norman Lock</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p129/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2014 07:29:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/01/p129/</guid><description>_The story was first published in Cranky Literary Journal, and subsequently appeared in Lock’s newest short story collection, Love Among the Particles, published in May, 2013, by Bellevue Literary Press, New York City.

A few minutes later, the receptionist let her know that the beautician was ready. Eyebrows would be dealt with first.

She’d visited her favorite shoe store with my Visa and used the back of the receipt to write a Dear Jude note. Her handwriting was precise.

This is a zen koan. I invented it. I was masturbating or was about to masturbate when I invented it. Actually, it is preposterously wrong to say I invented it. Nobody invents a koan, it just pops into your head.

Back in the day, what seemed to bind their lives from one day to the next was the sweet spicy smell that wafted from the kitchen every morning. There was something inexplicable about it.

That someone had already greeted dawn before they broke their slumber.</description></item></channel></rss>
