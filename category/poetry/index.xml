My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</description></item><item><title>Universe on a Banana Leaf – by Sumit Shetty</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 05:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</guid><description>There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Karan Kapoor</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:56:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</guid><description>Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Kathleen Bryson</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</guid><description>First Person

This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and
the receipts of the past. I wish
for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the

“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch</description></item><item><title>Two poems – by Kenneth Pobo</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:14:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</guid><description>Petaled Geography
We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us
each morning. Orange, a song
which they will teach us. Mexico
on a thick stalk.

amnesia is an attic full of salvation,
a tainted spine brewing soft waters into memory.
you speak a language recently forgotten,
of sentences reeking of mason jars and tombstones;
weaving a sister tongue of lost identity
I often wonder if you remember how warm figs taste like, or the scent of sour raisins staining your shoulder,

like her private garden.
Tending to me
like a page from her Koran,
or like the kantha my foremothers stitched.
Nine minutes of complete attention.
Every stem, every root, every bend.

Stretching? she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,
we are collaborators, co-gardeners and florists, all in one.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Anesce Dremen</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1242/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 03:19:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1242/</guid><description>The Pianist
Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Aekta Khubchandani</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 01:34:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</guid><description>How to know that you’re new to New York
The mailman is your friend now. His wife and you both practice yoga. She’s into hot yoga, you’re following the Iyengar school. He, the mailman and you are both happy about this conversation.

in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,
with slurries, and piss, dour hiking trips to the ravine.
Man on the bridge: You’re not welcome here.
Bring immigration papers—he glowered from the ravine.
Suspicion begets suspicions for truth
seekers. Be on time for coffee hour at the ravine.
The Sufi crunches halves of maple leaf jalebi.</description></item><item><title>Death in February – by Huzaifa Pandit</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1202/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 03:38:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1202/</guid><description>Once upon a routine death,
February snow wears a cold night

Of the hummingbird, disturbed

unfinished in the whorl.

Black spiders in my woodpile
asterisk a sharp distinction
between their brisk compaction
and the expansive human view.
These spiders aren’t the toxic
species that gleam in cellars
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.
They’re only shy little blobs
dedicated to devouring gnats.
Splitting oak and maple to burn
on spangled winter nights, I brush
these tiny creatures to safety
without damaging their many

The Library of Olan
turned upside down
when bombs of tear gas
were thrown into its dusty rooms.
The intention was to smoke out
those who refused to leave
their obsession of biting into tomes,

To fill the library with tears,
interrupt their exile with words,
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,
and corrupt the humor of books.

I enter the basement
of the Spinal Injuries Hospital. It is white,
walls and a bed and a curtain. Mom is holding my hand.

He dips his hand into a tub of white liquid, pouring more white powder into it.

The princess is nagging
The frog to sing

He is croaking notes while she

with the nonchalance of cattle
let loose by their owner
to wreak havoc on the neighbour’s farm.
It tramples all other thoughts,
and bites off some more

in the crevices of my skull
– like plants sprouting out of fantastic ruins.

Dead actors keep appearing on TV,

its movements,

Some slow in pace: something between a wish

Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle. Time and again, this table has witnessed the unbecoming of a story, or a moment becoming untraceable—you leaning against the wall, exhaling portions of nostalgia as the window tries to fathom every possible shape of departure.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Satya Dash</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:09:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</guid><description>(To preserve the format of the poems, we have made them available in a PDF document.

On their last night together,
he finds her naked on the
bed, his right hand on her chest, the left slowly probing what he is convinced is

On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph

My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead

On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house

Mother thunders into the kitchen,
a banished witch reclaiming her place

half a jar of salt into the rice
like she tipped over the wardrobe
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills

her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,

salted beyond salvation.

The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger

Where did the morning breeze halt?
Where did morning alight?
Faiz Ahmed Faiz
At an avant-garde café in uptown Pune,
the reserved tables celebrate
a teenager’s birthday in cosmopolitan English.
My nearly dead phone flares up with a call from home:
My mother laments in frayed Kashmiri:
_I am happy you aren’t home, two boys
were shot dead today.</description></item><item><title>//a mug hung around their necks like the curse of Ashwaththama// – by Abhijit Khandkar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p673/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 13:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p673/</guid><description>An overturned anda-bhurji cart of a hawker during a riot.
She who had borrowed money to set up this stall
brought in twelve crates of eggs for the day,
freshly baked loafs of bread, 5 kilo onions wholesale
and few cheap refined-oil cans by selling
all the clothes she owns
except the sari that she now adorns.
Stocks of beedis lying on the ground;
awaiting whores

Over a cup of chaha,
I stumbled over words
through a conversation
in a Marathi influenced by the American tongue.
My relatives and friends listened
their faces falling
and at that moment
in that conversation
the distance between us was much
further than that of the Atlantic Ocean.
I’ve picked up languages until now
as a consequence of picking up my life and placing it in lands where</description></item><item><title>Call From Kyoto – by Poornima Laxmeshwar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/01/p648/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 02:44:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/01/p648/</guid><description>When the phone doesn’t stop ringing,

**
On a channel, a day late in celebrating
Lata Mangeshkar’s birthday,
plays a song where Sadhana promises to haunt her lover
and Ma pierces a needle in her large stomach
pushing insulin into her body
diabetes, she reminds me, will eat your bones.
if you ever look at pictures
of those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis
you will find the bones parting ways from each other.</description></item><item><title>A Sense of Leaving – by Arun Sagar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/11/p615/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2017 09:37:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/11/p615/</guid><description>To preserve formatting, the poem is available for reading in PDF.

Death is a sure scent beyond the compound
and his season has arrived about a month ago.
There are no cats in the vicinity.
Only a dangerous number of young dogs.
The regular mate isn’t around.
Her owner has taken her away on a holiday.
One day, his risks at luring someone else paid off
and the ensuing rituals offered neighbours hope
that the embarrassment may stop.
But the scuffles and races must have been too brief</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Suhit Kelkar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 06:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</guid><description>Isosceles Majesty
It fluttered into sight,
forming ripples
on the night’s cool surface –
a faint beacon of grey,
the outlines blending.
It settled on the doorframe,
within reach of my tiny palms,
and I caught a glimpse of a plump body
tapering to a pointy end.
It would have been
merely incongruous
without the isosceles majesty
of swept-back wings –
stiff, powder-coated, frantic,
flapping in my fumbling grasp.
I grabbed the strange creature.</description></item><item><title>Beds – by Harnidh Kaur</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 03:52:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</guid><description>Four corners of a sheet tucked in haphazardly, little island of certainty for when the floor wobbles and the roof stares down at your eyes, a game of blink with stakes too high to forfeit – empty eggshells of unmade memories, ghost limbs curved into clammy folds, piled upon each other, want braided into need, tied with a ribbon-wisp torn off cotton sheets.
This is where screams are cushioned by pillows stuffed with dreams, where babies roll off the sides with such soft grace, tumbling over warnings, where hurt is first felt, an angry, red vision that floods nights, fevered breath and salt burning cheeks as it cuts a canyon of unsaid words, tectonic plates under lips shaking and shifting till their corners tighten a little permanently.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Mihir Chitre</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p528/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Dec 2016 07:20:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/12/p528/</guid><description>Study Leave
There is one tubelight in the hall
and the windows, whose glasses
are either broken or sold off,
give away more than they should.
I am studying the adjective clause
but can’t find one to describe my father.
What is it that he will blame my mother for tonight
before thrashing her against the wall?
I taper through the scissors of possibilities.
A private fear frosts my mind.</description></item><item><title>Nallamma – by Iniyavan Banumathi</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p504/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 12:00:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p504/</guid><description>To preserve the format, we’ve made Nallamma available on this link</description></item><item><title>Beloved K – by Aditi Uniyal</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p497/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 11:44:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/08/p497/</guid><description>I have dug knives in your shoulders
carefully, and they are still trying to
go deeper into your warm flesh-
I am sorry, dear, but I don’t know if

I have shot at your belly so you
can never bear any children,

I taught Sally how to hit her tambourine on 2 and 4. So many pink people hit on 1 and 3. And she could sing like birds: like nightingale, like whippoorwill, like western meadowlark, her voice so pure, like dawn-light, like twilight, like golden vegas, streams of light, golden fingers from the clouds. She sang for God; she sang for the group. Our praise band met Thursday nights up near the altar at the church.</description></item><item><title>कोई नज़्म लिखो – by Saurabh Jain</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/02/p414/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:49:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2016/02/p414/</guid><description>नज़्म लिखो , बेशुमार लिखो

The radio plays a dirge

the moonlight in my beers. My toothpaste
wasted on her charcoal lips.
The things I could do were few
and the things I couldn’t fewer.
The drugged street lamps; the lost
rickshaws in their long slumber. Now
she extends herself like a theorem</description></item><item><title>Interviewing a Beetroot – by Arjun Rajendran</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/09/p372/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Sep 2015 16:00:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/09/p372/</guid><description>To preserve the format, here is the linked pdf with the poem.

Some emails
are more difficult
to receive
from a child
long out of college
the daughter who writes
her cancer is back
but the doctor says
with chemo and surgery
things should be fine
and all the while
the father wonders
why she didn’t call
at midnight and let
the telephone scream
hysterically in the night
to deliver the news
a computer is too
cold a messenger</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Mihir Chitre</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</guid><description>Varanasi, December 2014
You unwelcomed me with fog
on a blinding night
hurrying into history
like the feet of your ghaats
As I crawl up
the rickety slope
of your refrigerated afternoon
I am spiral and backward
in time’s forsaken bedroom
where chaste Hindi adulterates
several slips of tongues
and the languid orality of people
mulls over suicidal lungs
You rise at sundown
by the Ganges
You bathe, you shiver</description></item><item><title>Poema – by Upasana Sarraju</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p271/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:48:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p271/</guid><description>**I (or The End Of Life)
