<p><strong>Calvin-in-exile</strong></p>
<p>Blue eyes, pupils dilating to the fire creeping<br>
up the cigarette butt,<br>
sickly yellow hair, swaying in the harsh blonde<br>
Beijing wind,</p>
<p>Lines on the face, canyons hewn by rapids<br>
over the century’s bends,<br>
Calvin Palmer, while still alive, wandered the <em>xueyuan’s</em><br>
corridors like a Dybbuk</p>
<p>trying to follow rules defining space and smoke,<br>
honored by the natives only in the breach.</p>
<p>While still alive, he often remembered<br>
the chilly morning he interviewed</p>
<p>the Grateful Dead (on the best day of his life)<br>
or the day he had covered princess Di’s visit</p>
<p>to his little town or the washed out county<br>
Viv Richards was to have played.</p>
<p>Mostly, he skipped over his stay<br>
at Beijing and the visit to the Great Wall</p>
<p>that never happened during his Exile. No plans.<br>
And no regrets</p>
<p>about making do with just <em>nihao</em> and <em>zaijian</em><br>
till his end.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Black Dog</strong></p>
<p>Whenever he barked back<br>
at the German Shepherd or the Pomeranian – tied to their sleeplessness<br>
and empty dinner bowls – my brother,<br>
would often remark that he was, in reality</p>
<p>a dog trapped inside the human body, though,<br>
on very drunk nights, he went belly dancing<br>
like no dog or man ever would/could.<br>
Fire crackers scared him<br>
And he hated the cricket ball.</p>
<p>Late one night, returning from a scrounging trip<br>
to keep the liquor flowing<br>
at someone else’s bachelor party – cheap and hosted<br>
on a borrowed terrace littered with plastic cups<br>
and KF Strong emptys – I found him lying<br>
on a <em>kutty yanai</em>, gaze fixed on a canine silhouette<br>
in the distance. He drank two more</p>
<p>Rounds, on resuming, and cried in earnest<br>
before throwing down the cup that wouldn’t mark<br>
its respect by shattering into pieces,</p>
<p>“Why did that black dog laugh at me?”</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>P.S: Kutty yanai – meaning little elephant is slang for the mini van with a open trolley/carriage used for moving goods within short distances</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mani</strong></p>
<p>In our colony, all dogs eventually came to be called as Mani.<br>
The numbered suffixes often forgotten,<br>
the canine empire, on paper, suffered<br>
no sunsets to the King’s name.</p>
<p>Three of the Manis<br>
that led the pack at different points<br>
in time traced their roots<br>
to Doti (short for Dog like Tiger), the half blood</p>
<p>Combai, which preferred freedom<br>
and the neighbor’s chicks to my mother’s vegetarian<br>
recipes. Doti did occasionally return to his<br>
original masters, if only to taste<br>
a morsel of <em>palaiya sadham</em> and <em>pacha molaga</em> or to retrieve<br>
the rubber ball from Mary teacher’s house (with biblical verses written on its compound wall)</p>
<p>when someone hit _six and out_in the game we played<br>
in the vacant plot marked by the surveyor’s stones – cemetery to<br>
the property boom that was to have visited the colony</p>
<p>a score years back , and later, to Doti himself, the first Mani<br>
to die of rabies and buried <em>hush hush</em> before we returned from</p>
<p>vacation to hear the story of his mysterious disappearance.</p>
