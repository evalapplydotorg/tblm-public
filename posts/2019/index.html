“All day I hunt for the liquid measure of your steps.” – Pablo Neruda
***
How easy it is to slip out of each other’s texts, playlists and event horizons. Watch a ship fall off the geodesic surface pinned down with the dreams and spittle of a billion-fold, parasitic species; watch the seas swell up with yearning for its wooden inhabitation.
An ant scampers dead leaf to fruit, moss to concrete honeycomb in search of (?

Night breaks apart like pomegranate seeds in my
palm.
The juice is everywhere, but who can see things when
they spill?
There’s only the smell and the incense of the heart
vomiting into the night. The night has been cut short,
the dream severed.
The dream like an octopus chewing the naked sense
of being.
What strangeness that myth and reality come like
twins?
As long as the juice burns the hand, its exotic smell

“टोक्यो के वसंत में आपका स्वागत है”, उतरने से पहले पॉयलट ने घोषणा की थी, “आप भाग्यशाली हैं कि चेरी ब्लॉसम वाले सप्ताहांत में आप इस खूबसूरत शहर में हैं। डाउन टाउन गिंजा की साकूरा डोरी, हिबिया पार्क, इम्पीरियल पैलेस के आस-पास और टोक्यो के सभी उपनगरों में चेरी के श्वेत गुलाबी फूल खिल रहे हैं।”

Yesterday, I watched Ana buy eggs at the chicken shop down the road from our house, and just as I registered the familiar smell of her hair – mint and cucumber, washed thrice a week, always with cold water – I felt her words settle into the bends of my ear canals and say, exactly as she’d done the first time we met, You know, you can tell a good egg from the bad ones if it sinks in a mug of water.

The setting is the fictitious hill station of Anandur in the Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu, South India, the Christian cemetery of the congregation of Saint Andrews.
Frederick Osbourne
(1901-1923)
I was young, brimming with enthusiasm for life,
eager for adventure.
When my uncle, the District Commissioner,
invited me to come out to Madras for a year
I embraced the chance.
I was enchanted at first
by so many exotic sights, sounds and smells –

Before the Divorce
On their last night together,
he finds her naked on the
bed, his right hand on her chest, the left slowly probing what he is convinced is
the grand canyon
of betrayal. For most, love comes in shape of a flute. Or a birthmark resembling forgiveness. She is a black piano standing beneath a waterfall.
Weary of the futility of grief,
she pulls him close.
A train passes at a distance.

The note reads nakedly: No one is to blame for my action. You leave it sprawled on the table next to the empty coffee cup, put your rimless glasses over it.
You are all set.
Your wife may not figure out the reason for this action. You made love the night before, after the child had fallen asleep. You looked fine, familiar. She lay holding you awhile. Her head on your chest, her glowing smile, her refreshed satisfaction.

The protagonist of this story is Mr. ABC i.e. Abdul Bari Choudhury. He has been residing in the US for a long time. Though seven seas and thirteen rivers away from the homeland, he has genuine feelings for his country. This feeling has dragged him to Bangladesh after a long time. He, however, did not embark on his homeward journey all alone. He made his better-half join the bandwagon. This he did deliberately.

Calvin-in-exile
Blue eyes, pupils dilating to the fire creeping
up the cigarette butt,
sickly yellow hair, swaying in the harsh blonde
Beijing wind,
Lines on the face, canyons hewn by rapids
over the century’s bends,
Calvin Palmer, while still alive, wandered the xueyuan’s
corridors like a Dybbuk
trying to follow rules defining space and smoke,
honored by the natives only in the breach.
While still alive, he often remembered
the chilly morning he interviewed

it’s difficult to say what
we are fleeing: the city is far

read or sleep, their faces suggest
peace. but something dark curls
around my shoulders.
blue must be the colour

CALANGUTE
For R.D: In memoriam
On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph
with their tremulous, teary smoke and sickly-sweet fragrance.
My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead
from this monsoon seascape of exile and grief.
No pearls here, not even a seashell.
His cache is bathetic: Pepsi and 7Up bottle caps,

Cabbage Moth
Mother is watching a video about raagi
flour and how to knead her way into father’s
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so
I will remember to tell him. I forget.
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk
and consistency and taste.

From a schoolgirl’s diary
On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house
where he sat in lotus position, eyes closed,
filling the circular room that was earth,
his conical head touching the arched sky.
Saturday was holiday for school. Papa would
be at his office. Mama was always absent;
she was in Dubai nursing an Arab’s girl.
On Saturdays my home was a silent cave
except for a drone rising from nowhere.

Salt
Mother thunders into the kitchen,
a banished witch reclaiming her place
amidst the arcane, and tips
half a jar of salt into the rice
like she tipped over the wardrobe
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been
salted beyond salvation.
It is only years later I understand the ire,
the ignominy of under-salted rice.

**“After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script”~

This is the splintering. This is the passport
which still reads Lahore,
India. This is also the indiscretion. What
no scrubbing can erase, for the way
sameness seeps through cracks and
makes itself known. To speak my father’s
tongue is to be absent. It is to wash one’s
hair with unknown waters and allow
