For R.D: In memoriam
On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph
with their tremulous, teary smoke and sickly-sweet fragrance.
My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead
from this monsoon seascape of exile and grief.
No pearls here, not even a seashell.
His cache is bathetic: Pepsi and 7Up bottle caps,</description></item><item><title>Five Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 03:41:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</guid><description>Cabbage Moth
Mother is watching a video about raagi
flour and how to knead her way into father’s
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so
I will remember to tell him. I forget.
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk
and consistency and taste.</description></item></channel></rss>
