***
How easy it is to slip out of each other’s texts, playlists and event horizons. Watch a ship fall off the geodesic surface pinned down with the dreams and spittle of a billion-fold, parasitic species; watch the seas swell up with yearning for its wooden inhabitation.
An ant scampers dead leaf to fruit, moss to concrete honeycomb in search of (?</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/12/p939/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2019 04:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/12/p939/</guid><description>(To preserve the format of the poems, we have made them available in a PDF document.

palm.
The juice is everywhere, but who can see things when
they spill?
There’s only the smell and the incense of the heart
vomiting into the night. The night has been cut short,
the dream severed.
The dream like an octopus chewing the naked sense
of being.
What strangeness that myth and reality come like
twins?

Frederick Osbourne
(1901-1923)
I was young, brimming with enthusiasm for life,
eager for adventure.
When my uncle, the District Commissioner,
invited me to come out to Madras for a year
I embraced the chance.
I was enchanted at first
by so many exotic sights, sounds and smells –</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/08/p886/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 04:32:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/08/p886/</guid><description>Before the Divorce
On their last night together,
he finds her naked on the
bed, his right hand on her chest, the left slowly probing what he is convinced is
the grand canyon
of betrayal. For most, love comes in shape of a flute. Or a birthmark resembling forgiveness. She is a black piano standing beneath a waterfall.
Weary of the futility of grief,
she pulls him close.
A train passes at a distance.</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/06/p861/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 02:44:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/06/p861/</guid><description>To preserve the format of these poems, we have made them available as PDF.

Blue eyes, pupils dilating to the fire creeping
up the cigarette butt,
sickly yellow hair, swaying in the harsh blonde
Beijing wind,
Lines on the face, canyons hewn by rapids
over the century’s bends,
Calvin Palmer, while still alive, wandered the xueyuan’s
corridors like a Dybbuk
trying to follow rules defining space and smoke,
honored by the natives only in the breach.
While still alive, he often remembered

For R.D: In memoriam
On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph
with their tremulous, teary smoke and sickly-sweet fragrance.
My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead
from this monsoon seascape of exile and grief.
No pearls here, not even a seashell.
His cache is bathetic: Pepsi and 7Up bottle caps,</description></item><item><title>Five Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Mar 2019 03:41:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/03/p817/</guid><description>Cabbage Moth
Mother is watching a video about raagi
flour and how to knead her way into father’s
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so
I will remember to tell him. I forget.
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk
and consistency and taste.</description></item><item><title>Buddha At The Museum</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p810/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:53:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p810/</guid><description>From a schoolgirl’s diary
On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house
where he sat in lotus position, eyes closed,
filling the circular room that was earth,
his conical head touching the arched sky.
Saturday was holiday for school. Papa would
be at his office. Mama was always absent;
she was in Dubai nursing an Arab’s girl.
On Saturdays my home was a silent cave
except for a drone rising from nowhere.</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p808/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:51:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p808/</guid><description>Salt
Mother thunders into the kitchen,
a banished witch reclaiming her place
amidst the arcane, and tips
half a jar of salt into the rice
like she tipped over the wardrobe
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been
salted beyond salvation.
It is only years later I understand the ire,
the ignominy of under-salted rice.</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p806/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Jan 2019 03:46:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2019/01/p806/</guid><description>**“After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script”~

This is the splintering. This is the passport

India. This is also the indiscretion. What
