<h2>Two poems – by Zoya Chadha</h2>
<p>**“After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script”~<br>
**<br>
This is the splintering. This is the passport<br>
which still reads Lahore,<br>
India. This is also the indiscretion. What<br>
no scrubbing can erase, for the way<br>
sameness seeps through cracks and<br>
makes itself known. To speak my father’s<br>
tongue is to be absent. It is to wash one’s<br>
hair with unknown waters and allow<br>
the knots to remain. To speak this way<br>
is to be stranded in a different time,<br>
to trace his home as though it were mine.<br>
And I am still turning it around in my hands.</p>
<p>My father’s tongue has survived<br>
in parts. So will I.</p>
<p>~<em>“Panjab University: ‘Starting Shahmukhi script progressive step… will help us know each other’”, The Indian Express, May 21 2018.</em></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>**“Rochester at Daryaganj Sunday Market”<br>
**</p>
<p>The vendor tapes the paperback shut.<br>
He fools most. But it isn’t new.<br>
And after two rounds of haggling<br>
he opens it saying look,<br>
it is worth more my price<br>
than yours. Take a cheaper one if–<br>
but the foxing stains give it away.<br>
We each compromise<br>
and it is mine. A copy in grey and white,<br>
a <em>Wide Sargasso Sea</em>.</p>
<p>On flipping through, later<br>
I find the pages curling<br>
with dampness. The spine, too,<br>
is frail. Only a small nudge<br>
and it will come apart.<br>
Just like that.</p>
<p>But I am already in the metro; the skies<br>
are falling. The sorrow over a bad bargain<br>
must be reaped, quickly.</p>
