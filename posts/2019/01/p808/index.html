<h2>Three Poems – by Zainab Ummer Farook</h2>
<p><strong>Salt</strong></p>
<p>Mother thunders into the kitchen,<br>
a banished witch reclaiming her place<br>
amidst the arcane, and tips<br>
half a jar of salt into the rice<br>
like she tipped over the wardrobe<br>
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills<br>
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,<br>
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,<br>
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been<br>
salted beyond salvation.</p>
<p>It is only years later I understand the ire,<br>
the ignominy of under-salted rice.<br>
Second by bland second, hour by insipid hour,<br>
I stew in my gruel of accumulated griefs,<br>
its thick, viscous numbness eating away<br>
at my stomach. The tears are long gone.<br>
I seek refuge by the sea, yearning for feeling,<br>
flavour, salt. I could lick it clean off the air at Marina<br>
or maybe just walk into the waves, the weight<br>
of unwritten poems lining my pockets — but then</p>
<p>I’d nest in the sand and never leave,<br>
my snail-shell fort resolute against the unhurried<br>
assault of brine. For now, my tongue must weather<br>
days that taste of nothing, as it hankers for the wispy<br>
burst of joy from a salted caramel ice-cream.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Spelling Bee</strong></p>
<p>I bite<br>
into the word.</p>
<p>It tastes of hot summer sun<br>
and thorny wood, staining<br>
my tongue a deep leafy green</p>
<p>and leaching vowels,<br>
the consonants left bursting<br>
like pink popping candy.</p>
<p>They say it’s French, but<br>
it is as much Kannada as it is<br>
love’s language</p>
<p>for I buried it, once,<br>
in a kindergarten playground<br>
with a half-remembered rhyme</p>
<p><em>ondu dina<br>
peddana hendathi oblu<br>
laddu maadidlu</em></p>
<p>and I saw them<br>
grow old, flowering<br>
into memory.</p>
<p>I bite<br>
into the word, or maybe<br>
it bites into me.</p>
<p>When a wide-eyed five-year-old<br>
grabs a prickly arm<br>
of that great big tree</p>
<p>and bids it yield to her whim,<br>
he nods assent —<br>
slowly, lumberingly, but only</p>
<p>if she called him by his name.<br>
Then, in a sudden blurry quiver<br>
of brown, the earth shakes</p>
<p>and all that remains<br>
is papery pink rain<br>
against solid blue sky</p>
<p>crowning me princess<br>
of a long-lost dreamland,<br>
as I spell</p>
<p>b-o-u-g-a-i-n-v-i-l-l-e-a</p>
<p>and dig up<br>
the roots of all things.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miseducation</strong></p>
<p>Our paths diverged when you told me of Hind’s rage:<br>
how she rode into the rotting remains of the battle<br>
sought the corpse of her uncle’s killer,<br>
dug deep into his entrails, yanked out<br>
the liver and chewed her way through it.</p>
<p>As the story unfolded itself, part by bloody part,<br>
(shudders, shivers, bile rising in the room)<br>
I thought: <em>what a badass, this Hind</em>.</p>
<p>Then it turned out she joined the Righteous,<br>
shedding her hunger like snakeskin. I sighed.<br>
Even liver-eaters receive His mercy, or so you said,<br>
and in some corner of my head, the story ate dust.<br>
Some days, however, Hind gallops horseback</p>
<p>into my dreams, whispers: <em>the liver?<br>
Feast on everything you can, love,<br>
but eat the eyes first</em>.</p>
