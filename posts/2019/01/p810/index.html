<h2>Buddha At The Museum – by Prathap Kamath</h2>
<p><em>From a schoolgirl’s diary</em></p>
<p>On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house<br>
where he sat in lotus position, eyes closed,<br>
filling the circular room that was earth,<br>
his conical head touching the arched sky.</p>
<p>Saturday was holiday for school. Papa would<br>
be at his office. Mama was always absent;<br>
she was in Dubai nursing an Arab’s girl.<br>
On Saturdays my home was a silent cave<br>
except for a drone rising from nowhere.</p>
<p>Buddha was sexy with broad shoulders,<br>
a glowing body, slender waist, long folded legs.<br>
His bony arms grew towards me like tendrils,<br>
his fingers caressed me all over<br>
but mostly my breasts and thighs<br>
where they frisked like puppies.<br>
Looking into me he vanished the others.<br>
We would be alone. He sat me on his lap<br>
and taught me the nine virtues in whispers<br>
that heated me down to my toes.</p>
<p>On Saturday nights Papa moved in his sleep;<br>
he threw his arms into air around women<br>
whose names he purred between gasps.<br>
Sometimes he let off a sob as though<br>
he was complaining to his mother,<br>
his schoolboy knees bleeding from a fall.</p>
<p>By midnight I was laid in my little womb<br>
where soft tongues licked me to nirvana;<br>
Buddha buried his face between my breasts<br>
and fought the night shapes of solitude.</p>
