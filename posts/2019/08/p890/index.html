<p><em>The setting is the fictitious hill station of Anandur in the Palani Hills of Tamil Nadu, South India, the Christian cemetery of the congregation of Saint Andrews.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frederick Osbourne</strong><br>
(1901-1923)</p>
<p>I was young, brimming with enthusiasm for life,<br>
eager for adventure.<br>
When my uncle, the District Commissioner,<br>
invited me to come out to Madras for a year<br>
I embraced the chance.</p>
<p>I was enchanted at first<br>
by so many exotic sights, sounds and smells –<br>
comely women gliding by in elegant saris,<br>
the scent of jasmine;<br>
monsoon clouds churning in the infinite sky;<br>
alluring chants echoing in ancient temples.<br>
The mystery of India intoxicated me.</p>
<p>But within weeks I was laid low<br>
by insidious maladies.<br>
I lost the bloom of my youth,<br>
I lost the will to live,<br>
I wasted away.<br>
They sent me to Anandur to recover, but I didn’t.</p>
<p>India, you seduced me –<br>
And then you destroyed me!</p>
<p>So now I lie here, forgotten.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nathaniel Greencross</strong><br>
(1866-1928)</p>
<p>I never meant to spend my life in this exasperating country,<br>
among heathens, where there is no order and no sense of propriety.</p>
<p>When I was named District Commissioner<br>
I lived in the cantonment,<br>
working tirelessly to make India worthy as<br>
the Jewel in the Crown of the British Empire.<br>
But I was thwarted at every turn.</p>
<p>Finally, ready to retire,<br>
eagerly anticipating my return to England,<br>
I was run down and mangled by a run-away cart<br>
at the crossroads in Peryakulum.<br>
I expired on a filthy charpoy in that god-forsaken town.<br>
Oh, the indignity of such an end!</p>
<p>And now, to be interred here in the soil of India,<br>
I am mocked for all eternity.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ahmed and Raymond</strong><br>
(1946-1962; 1947-1962)</p>
<p>We were best friends, in school and out.<br>
We studied, played sports and shared our lives.<br>
On an overnight hike to Nandipurum<br>
we got lost, stumbled through the brush,<br>
then slipped down an embankment,<br>
Landing on an outcropping.<br>
We huddled together during the chill of the night.<br>
Our calls went unheard,<br>
nobody could find us.</p>
<p>We perished in each other’s arms,<br>
A Christian and a Moslem.</p>
<p>Proclaim that from your pulpits –<br>
We dare you!</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reverend Kraus</strong><br>
(1901-1964)</p>
<p>The mission sent me to India, to Madras,<br>
to minister to the community.<br>
One day I visited the great temple in Madurai,<br>
sacred to Shiva and Meenakshi, His consort.<br>
I was smitten with what I saw:<br>
incense, light, color, chanting, devotion –<br>
Here was mystery! Here was magic!</p>
<p>I learned Tamil, I wore a dhoti,<br>
I joined the religious processions,<br>
I immersed myself in the sacred world<br>
that had been revealed to me.</p>
<p>When I neglected my duties the mission let me go.<br>
But I could not bear to leave India.<br>
Even when my family returned to Germany I stayed on.<br>
The hymn to Lord Shiva from the tenth century, the Tiruvacagam, obsessed me<br>
and I felt called to translate it into my own language.<br>
The divine task uplifted my soul.</p>
<p>“Victory to the foot of the King, who soothed my soul’s unrest and made me His!”</p>
<p>I died a Hindu, in a state of grace.<br>
Om Namah Shivaya!</p>
<p>The mission insisted my ashes be interred here in the Christian cemetery.<br>
But why?<br>
I am a stranger here.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Theodora Watson</strong><br>
(1878-1959)</p>
<p>I was born in Bombay under the Raj and loved my life.<br>
My father was a businessman.<br>
We spent the hot season in the hill stations<br>
where I spent my days in leisure<br>
at the club playing tennis,<br>
boating on the lake.</p>
<p>One day it all ended.<br>
The British packed up and left, the Raj was finished.<br>
And so was the joy I knew.</p>
<p>I could not go to England,<br>
a place that was foreign to me.<br>
I stayed on in Anandur, giving piano lessons<br>
to the children of wealthy locals.</p>
<p>Everything and everyone I had known was gone.<br>
I lived in an empty world, one filled with memories<br>
of a life that had passed into nothingness.<br>
Loneliness enveloped me like an old shawl.<br>
I died a spinster.</p>
<p>‘Gentle Miss Watson’ they called me.<br>
They could not read the bitterness in my heart.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mabel Moores</strong><br>
(1852-1915)</p>
<p>I am Mabel Moores who spent my life quietly,<br>
doing good for others, working tirelessly for the mission,<br>
the orphanage and the food pantry.<br>
Everyone thought I was the embodiment of Christian virtue.</p>
<p>And I was.</p>
<p>But few recognized that I had a heart<br>
in need of sustenance, just like everyone else.<br>
Sebastian Subramanian, the caretaker of St. Andrews, became my partner, my lover.<br>
We met in secret for many years, hiding our love, our passion from Anundur.<br>
But an Englishwoman does not consort with natives.<br>
It is the unspoken rule that I flaunted.</p>
<p>But I lived well, I loved well –<br>
better than any of you could ever imagine!</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Callum Quinn</strong><br>
(1882-1890)</p>
<p>They brought me here when I was but eight years old.<br>
How can that be?<br>
My life had hardly begun.</p>
<p>Mummy told me never to swim alone, but I did,<br>
in the lake of Anandur.<br>
Ayah’s back was turned, I wanted to catch the duck…..</p>
<p>And when I was in too deep and couldn’t swim,<br>
there was no one to hear my cries.<br>
I was so afraid as the water swallowed me up<br>
and I sank down, down, down,<br>
to the muddy bottom.</p>
<p>Then there was darkness.</p>
<p>Now I rest quietly here as above me, every night,<br>
the stars turn in the vast arc of heaven.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Nikandan</strong><br>
(1891-1958)</p>
<p>I was the beggar always positioned on the bund.<br>
Citizens of Anandur, you didn’t know my name and didn’t want to.<br>
For most of you I was invisible, a pitiable sight,<br>
My legs wrapped in dirty bandages,<br>
my teeth crooked or missing,<br>
my mouth discolored by years of chewing pan.</p>
<p>The fine Anglo ladies and gentlemen<br>
would stop to admire the view of the lake.<br>
When they deigned to look at me<br>
it was with disgust.</p>
<p>Yet some of you were kind to me<br>
and helped me in my hard life,<br>
giving me food or rupees.</p>
<p>For you I always offered fervent prayers to Lord Ram,<br>
that he bless you and protect you.</p>
<p>Thus, I gave you more than you gave to me.<br>
Rama Nama Satya Hai!</p>
