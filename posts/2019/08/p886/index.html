<p><strong>Before the Divorce</strong></p>
<p>On their last night together,<br>
he finds her naked on the<br>
bed, his right hand on her chest, the left slowly probing what he is convinced is</p>
<p>the grand canyon<br>
of betrayal. For most, love comes in shape of a flute. Or a birthmark resembling forgiveness. She is a black piano standing beneath a waterfall.</p>
<p>Weary of the futility of grief,<br>
she pulls him close.<br>
A train passes at a distance.<br>
Neither hears the other breathing.<br>
The kitchen drain is choked with leftovers.</p>
<p>Its drain croaking in broken Morse Code.<br>
<em>Did did did da da da did did did.</em></p>
<p>The train plunges into the dark as he looses<br>
his fingers in her hair. A broken inkpot of black.</p>
<p>It begins to rain.<br>
Dry leaves choke the drain. It is not Fall for nothing.. A stray white shoe<br>
clogs the drain</p>
<p>like a misplaced full stop.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Reunion</strong></p>
<p><em>(for CC)</em></p>
<p>On that cold winters’ morning<br>
I swam in a burr of traffic – teachers, jokes,<br>
old anecdotes, an odd sweetheart, life’s lessons in gratitude<br>
scattered like goldenrods<br>
and those hiding places<br>
where we left and lost<br>
the odd vacancies we would never<br>
recover – a kerchief, foil balls, the first smells of<br>
sweat and melancholy. The thought<br>
of a kiss. Perhaps.</p>
<p>I met the boy, just as I thought I would –<br>
huddled in a corner, looking at his watch,<br>
waiting to go back to his room,<br>
sink into bed and read himself to sleep.<br>
The boy stared at me from memory’s edge,<br>
smiling, content to know I still remembered.</p>
<p>Then there was this old sweetheart – the point<br>
of this poem after all. Having lost none of her charm,<br>
she was still the nightingale flying over wet meadow<br>
into light and sunflowers. She spoke<br>
with the surety of a married woman. Skin<br>
a shade of burnished stone. She and her husband<br>
wanted to start a restaurant<br>
in a quiet Scandinavian town.</p>
<p>‘Please do invite me’, I bantered, ‘I would love to visit,<br>
see you quarter a chicken,<br>
sit at your restaurant<br>
done in burnt ochre and green.’</p>
<p>Stop pulling my leg, I am still only thinking!</p>
<p>I wanted to tell her, because at times the whole<br>
turns out lesser than the sum of its parts,<br>
it is preferable to keep the parts,<br>
and let go of the whole.</p>
<p>Like combing the night of fireflies<br>
and keeping them<br>
in this perforated jar</p>
<p>of a poem.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Oranges</strong></p>
<p>Unpeeling these oranges takes me<br>
into the wrinkled hand<br>
of a woman who gave my father a name.</p>
<p>It was said of her that she was a shrewd woman, though<br>
benevolent to her servants. I remember their lot<br>
huddled in front of the black and white TV, each<br>
Sunday, watching Mahabharata, much to<br>
mother’s chagrin.</p>
<p>Her death was written on the walls of her home. It was<br>
foretold when her children decided to uproot<br>
her garden and make a house bigger than her memories,<br>
her longings, her strength from the time her young self<br>
had made an artificial urinary sphincter<br>
by cutting and joining condoms, for<br>
her dying husband.</p>
<p>And so she withered away and died in mother’s arms, her<br>
stomach a site of memory battling cancer, her absence<br>
a form of poetry I teach myself every day.</p>
<p>Orange is my Madeleine, its smell the vortex<br>
that was her grey, tranquil eyes.</p>
