Turmeric
My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.

There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?

Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.

First Person
I’m sure I initially saw you, the mandrill,
in a children’s illustrated photographic book or
possibly in a National Geographic pictorial and
I always think the same thing about your cream teeth and
Union Jack black red and blue mask
I always think the same thing
you are beautiful you are terrifying
I think, all hail the surreal primate troll
I think, the mammal clown with garish smeared soft

The colors are vivid. Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature. I couldn’t decline.

August Twenty-Twenty
This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and
the receipts of the past. I wish
for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the
blurred edges of time. I am asked
to let go, so instead I sit at the ledge
with a hand dangling outside, collecting rain for warmer days, when perhaps

diwali outside, & names smoke on my tongue
with the taste of burning diyas / in the TV’s
glitching glow the blue chips packet is passed
around, the remote has a coat of masala magic
from our fingers / with a touch, I harvest red
notification blossoms on green whatsapp boughs
watch the single tick split into two, then turn
blue under the dotted shade of typing, online
typing, last seen, typing… click on clickbaits

We wonder what the moth wonders
when she flutters to the lone,
warm bulb that stutters
in the nondescript nook of our house,
possibly looking for faith the way we do.
If she does find it fumbling in trepid waters
that are first bitter and soon engulfing like most
unfamiliar emotions, we may think she is where
we are, at the brink of realizing that we are not

The Shape of the Known Universe

After Sirens
triage and questions, a stretcher
and the littoral cadences of emergency.
Voices, soft and sharp, whisk
between a young man’s
lacerations and an old woman
drowsing under a grey bob
on a cart in a corridor while
her husband shifts weight
