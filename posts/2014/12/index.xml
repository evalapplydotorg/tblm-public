TBLM did the exercise of asking its contributors to write back with a couple of their favorite books read in 2014. We basically asked for the books that really made a difference for them this year. Some responded, and voila, now we have an awesome TBR list for all you readers.

To Start With,
He closes his eyes and finds today’s date floating towards him. Shimmering in the darkness, swiveling— like the text on the Windows 95 screensaver. It seeps in through his forehead and gets absorbed. 23-04-98 is now a part of him. Today’s date, a Saturday, when the first sign of what he so eagerly awaited has appeared.</description></item><item><title>Because If Nothing Matters</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p225/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 13:43:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p225/</guid><description>It didn’t occur to me till much later that Joe had stopped coming to the library. I used to go to the British Council library regularly, and had chatted with him a couple of times. Now I had often met curious people before but he was the most eccentric among the lot. The kind that spend whole afternoons amidst stacks not because they like being surrounded by books, but because they have nowhere else to go.</description></item><item><title>Hope That He Hears</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p221/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2014 16:39:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2014/12/p221/</guid><description>You are secretly in love with your cousin. Every vacation, in your grandmother’s house, you watch him grow a few more inches, and of late display a few more sprouts of hair. You marvel at how his voice is better than that of any boy you have heard. You also marvel at how he can sing English songs you have never heard before. Every time he touches your palm, in an attempt to teach you the right way to strike on the carrom board, you struggle to control your smile, and struggle to control the spreading of a warm, fuzzy feeling that honestly leaves you baffled.</description></item></channel></rss>
