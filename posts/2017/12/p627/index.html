<p>**Diabetes at a Birthday Party<br>
**<br>
On a channel, a day late in celebrating<br>
Lata Mangeshkar’s birthday,<br>
plays a song where Sadhana promises to haunt her lover<br>
and Ma pierces a needle in her large stomach<br>
pushing insulin into her body<br>
<em>diabetes</em>, she reminds me, <em>will eat your bones</em>.</p>
<p>if you ever look at pictures<br>
of those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis<br>
you will find the bones parting ways from each other.<br>
Ma’s bones haven’t begun that journey yet<br>
but if diabetes wins this war of diseases<br>
they may not have to.</p>
<p><em>This is not a good Lata song</em>, Baba complains<br>
<em>so many songs to choose from and they play this</em><br>
he complains the way Ma complains about the needle<br>
that has broken inside her skin</p>
<p>Baba whose knees hurt when he bends them<br>
is a perfect candidate for a Moov commercial<br>
<em>Aah se Aahatak</em><br>
he says with a conviction<br>
that has been practiced over years.</p>
<p>He claims to have reached the place<br>
only Yudhistir could, but came back<br>
because he isn’t fond of dogs<br>
because I was eating Maggi and waiting for him</p>
<p>His stomach is hard, dried-up in the sun<br>
frozen in time<br>
from selling daris to people.<br>
He narrated an O’ Henry story on his retirement<br>
and everyone looked puzzled, but impressed<br>
<em>which Henry was this</em>, they asked,<br>
I, II, III, IV?<br>
turning him into a historian when he<br>
just wanted to be a storyteller</p>
<p>I was always cautious of not using Ma’s comb<br>
dandruff was contagious, I always thought<br>
but it turned out to be hereditary.<br>
Sometimes out of boredom<br>
I scratch my head and watch dandruff snowflakes<br>
fall on my keyboard.<br>
my scalp bleeds silently as I pick the white chunks<br>
spreading on my head like the map of Scandinavia</p>
<p>A different Lata song is being played now<br>
Ma likes indulging in trivia<br>
<em>Priya Rajvansh was Naveen Nischal’s best friend</em>,<br>
she informs her audience<br>
<em>Betaab dil ki tammana yahi hai</em><br>
she sings complaining<br>
about her broken voice that can’t hold a note<br>
<em>diabetes</em>, she reminds me, <em>will eat your vocal chords</em>.</p>
<p>And I wonder silently,<br>
who talks about diabetes at someone’s birthday party?<br>
Ma’s life is a cautionary tale.</p>

<p>**My Mother Sings Disco Diwane<br>
**<br>
When I am seven, Aai undergoes a surgery<br>
to remove cysts blocking her breasts.<br>
I fall asleep in the math class and dream of her.<br>
She wears a hipster headband in my dream, like Rekha<br>
in <em>Ek toh kam zindagani</em>, but sings a different song.<br>
Rekha, my mother’s namesake, tries to wake me up,<br>
But Judy Jones, my class teacher, pushes her away<br>
and I don’t get a gold star for my homework that day.</p>
<p>When she comes back from the hospital<br>
I ask her about the song she was singing in my dream.<br>
She teaches me <em>Raat aur din diya jaale</em> that night,<br>
and I win our colony’s Sa Re Ga Ma Pa,<br>
with popular consensus.<br>
So I get to sit on the lap of Aazoba’s friend<br>
for as long as I like.</p>
<p>Aai’s stomach bears three biblical crosses<br>
from a recent gallbladder removal surgery.<br>
With the stretch marks from two pregnancies<br>
and several small scars from the insulin needle<br>
crowding her stomach, Aai’s body<br>
is the bloodiest site of worship.</p>
<p>She complaints of being addicted to laxatives,<br>
every night, she drinks 10ml of EMTY,<br>
and jokes about it not emptying her stomach well enough.<br>
She wakes up from her afternoon nap saying,<br>
<em>It would be great if I could pass some gas</em>,<br>
and starts singing <em>Disco Diwane</em>, as if<br>
it’s the cure for constipation.</p>
<p>Aai, the pop sensation of the 80s is back again today.<br>
Ahaan!</p>
