About the novel (from Goodreads)
A highly charged fiction debut about a young woman in India, and the love that both shatters and transforms her. She is twenty, restless in New Delhi. Her mother has died; her father has left for Singapore. He is a few years older, just back to India from New York.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Suhit Kelkar</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 06:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</guid><description>Isosceles Majesty
It fluttered into sight,
forming ripples
on the night’s cool surface –
a faint beacon of grey,
the outlines blending.
It settled on the doorframe,
within reach of my tiny palms,
and I caught a glimpse of a plump body
tapering to a pointy end.
It would have been
merely incongruous
without the isosceles majesty
of swept-back wings –
stiff, powder-coated, frantic,
flapping in my fumbling grasp.
I grabbed the strange creature.</description></item></channel></rss>
