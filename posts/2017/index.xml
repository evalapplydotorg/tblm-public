While this is a comment on the sort of violently obsessive love glamorised in films such as Darr (1993), Raanjhanaa (2013) and others, it is also a reflection on the violence of language and memory:

**
On a channel, a day late in celebrating
Lata Mangeshkar’s birthday,
plays a song where Sadhana promises to haunt her lover
and Ma pierces a needle in her large stomach
pushing insulin into her body
diabetes, she reminds me, will eat your bones.
if you ever look at pictures
of those suffering from rheumatoid arthritis
you will find the bones parting ways from each other.</description></item><item><title>A Sense of Leaving</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/11/p615/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2017 09:37:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/11/p615/</guid><description>To preserve formatting, the poem is available for reading in PDF.

Death is a sure scent beyond the compound
and his season has arrived about a month ago.
There are no cats in the vicinity.
Only a dangerous number of young dogs.
The regular mate isn’t around.
Her owner has taken her away on a holiday.
One day, his risks at luring someone else paid off
and the ensuing rituals offered neighbours hope
that the embarrassment may stop.
But the scuffles and races must have been too brief</description></item><item><title>Deepti Kapoor</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p542/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 06:10:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p542/</guid><description>This interview was conducted by e-mail.

About the novel (from Goodreads)
A highly charged fiction debut about a young woman in India, and the love that both shatters and transforms her. She is twenty, restless in New Delhi. Her mother has died; her father has left for Singapore. He is a few years older, just back to India from New York.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 May 2017 06:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/05/p540/</guid><description>Isosceles Majesty
It fluttered into sight,
forming ripples
on the night’s cool surface –
a faint beacon of grey,
the outlines blending.
It settled on the doorframe,
within reach of my tiny palms,
and I caught a glimpse of a plump body
tapering to a pointy end.
It would have been
merely incongruous
without the isosceles majesty
of swept-back wings –
stiff, powder-coated, frantic,
flapping in my fumbling grasp.
I grabbed the strange creature.</description></item><item><title>Beds</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 03:52:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2017/04/p537/</guid><description>Four corners of a sheet tucked in haphazardly, little island of certainty for when the floor wobbles and the roof stares down at your eyes, a game of blink with stakes too high to forfeit – empty eggshells of unmade memories, ghost limbs curved into clammy folds, piled upon each other, want braided into need, tied with a ribbon-wisp torn off cotton sheets.
This is where screams are cushioned by pillows stuffed with dreams, where babies roll off the sides with such soft grace, tumbling over warnings, where hurt is first felt, an angry, red vision that floods nights, fevered breath and salt burning cheeks as it cuts a canyon of unsaid words, tectonic plates under lips shaking and shifting till their corners tighten a little permanently.</description></item></channel></rss>
