<p>SEASON</p>
<p>Death is a sure scent beyond the compound<br>
and his season has arrived about a month ago.<br>
There are no cats in the vicinity.<br>
Only a dangerous number of young dogs.</p>
<p>The regular mate isn’t around.<br>
Her owner has taken her away on a holiday.<br>
One day, his risks at luring someone else paid off<br>
and the ensuing rituals offered neighbours hope<br>
that the embarrassment may stop.<br>
But the scuffles and races must have been too brief<br>
to take the hoarseness out of his throb.<br>
He still calls and disgusted women shush him</p>
<p>until his sadness is nothing short of the theatrical<br>
for those who have endured this little drama through the days,<br>
and some awkward householder suggests vitamins.<br>
<em>He hardly eats, droops on the doormat,<br>
has stopped hunting sparrows…</em></p>
<p>Every day, some more of the feral in him<br>
dies into a dull slackness<br>
and extinguished eyes return from aimless prowls<br>
to wail near a window that does not open.</p>
<p>The indifferent houses go on<br>
knowing nothing of this vulgar ailment.<br>
And perhaps for a rasping fraternity deep in the bones,<br>
the men let him be when he starts again<br>
but the women have sensed<br>
a foul portent in his calls<br>
and hotly shoo him out of sight.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>LAMENT</p>
<p>The farmer has left,<br>
lightly closing the door<br>
on his sodden tools,<br>
his words, his songs,<br>
a few reasons with which<br>
he tilled his earth.<br>
The house rises alone<br>
by the pineapple-slopes<br>
of his woman’s eyes at dawn<br>
and tangled voices of life and weed<br>
cannot fill its gaping mouth anymore.<br>
The walls echo the chatter,<br>
the bickering and reconciliations,<br>
just as the swing returns the light<br>
of his absence and dreams.<br>
The roof has crumbled<br>
a little more to the east,<br>
where blood’s stream wove a garden<br>
with kisses and smiles trapped in photographs.<br>
When seed returns to earth, his children<br>
will follow the trail of a green blaze,<br>
wash death’s stain off windy curtains,<br>
eat of night’s full plate.<br>
And he’ll remain in the passing<br>
of shadow unto shadow,<br>
whistling in their breath as grain,<br>
the cut grass under the heavy pear tree,<br>
all that was set into song<br>
in the wavering light, fallen<br>
for a while on his desire’s plough.</p>
