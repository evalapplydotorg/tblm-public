Premonitions
1
A white room with monitors
an otherworldly space in winter
I see you from the flip side
of the soundproof glass-wall;
tubes inserted from every side
screens playing an unscripted
language in motion.
Your body is immobile – but your
eyes, they dart in all directions
in their yearning to remember –
our eyes meet for a moment,
I read the question inscribed
in your glance – what if death

Tuesday was a typical London day, which is to say, gray and wet. Fairchild Fortesque chose to walk the three blocks from The Victoria Hotel to the Bull Horn Pub, and by the time he stepped into the darkness, wished to hell he’d worn his raincoat. “Who knew a drizzle would turn into a deluge?” he asked the doorman.
“Only the British,” was the dry reply.
Fairchild admired laconic staff people.

When S first walked into the room, I took her for a woman around the age of fifty. Later, when I told her that, she said she would have preferred to look younger, like her younger sister who people said looked at least a decade younger than her actual age. She also clarified that I had not offended her. After all, she had always believed she looked older, much older than her age —a seventy-year-old?

_For Mama
_
***
Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow
her and say, in English, I miss the Arab
fisherman from Marina beach terribly.
The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish
every Saturday was special. She says
in Konkani. Dole pole. She points
at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.
Stale. Should have gone early
to the market, she sighs,
her finger still pointing.

He ran away when he was fifteen. The sleeper trains used to have green leather seats.
The news flash read: Traps are being laid to capture innocent animals and to enslave unsuspecting natives.
When the lodge owner asked for his address, he walked out.
Outings during June were fantastic with a good strong swell and off shore winds.

**When Shammi Kapoor slides down the snow
**
in Junglee, shouting ‘Yahoo’, they tell you it’s Kashmir
but it is actually Kufri, near Shimla.
When Ranbir Kapoor climbs up the snow
in YJHD, all moon-struck, they tell you it’s Manali
but it is actually Gulmarg, in Kashmir.
So we’ve always got it wrong – grand-uncle or
grand-nephew – and we’ve been like this for long, always
Kashmir without Kashmiris, all for a song.

If you’re wondering who we are, let me unravel the mystery. We are the untethered children of those that live rich, tethered lives. Filled with reckless desire, unlimited ambition and thriving delusions. The unwilling bearer of it all? The place we grew up in and never grew out of – Roseburn – the perfect little island, surrounded by The City on all sides. It has everything. High-rises, row-houses, commercial blocks filled with multi-national corporations, comedy-clubs, jazz clubs, chain restaurants, local haunts, internationally recognised educational institutions, a massive hospital and a few hundred medical clinics serving the people and pets of.

Every morning Joan and Gilly wake up before their children do, set the house and day in order, settle down in the balcony with two cups of tea and a newspaper. Joan cuts a loaf of bread and a pair of tomatoes – do tomatoes come in pairs? she wonders – takes the chutney from the big fridge in the small kitchen and places it all on the table where they eat.

Plantation House
Lazy heat on the veranda.
Slow crawl of days. Time ripples
like white veins through red marble.
The ceiling fan slaps a devil mask
in beating shadows. The man reads
a two-day-old Financial Times,
taps ash from a cheroot. The woman
wears a white dress and straw hat,

Distant memories approach me – I am looking in a water well, an elephant is plucking peepul leaves in the dense forest, and her mahout is laughing.
I am sprinting along narrow past-roads, fields of corns
and pulses covered in evening smoke,
the villages of many doors and windows.
It was my fifth grade when I saw a snake slithering in the harvested wheat field. A bare tree and its succulent drumsticks.

i.
Almost always, I think of you fondly.
Like: clouds think of rain;
Like: words think of sentences;
Like: women think of orgasms.
ii.
But sometimes, dead
from the shoulders down
when we aggressively silently—Chomskily—
protest to one another: You’re wrong. You lie.
We wonder if others notice.
They must. Our animosity
obvious as the page of a second-hand Saramago
where the previous reader
had given up. A book
unhandled—the spine unbroken.

Recently, a combined bundle of chapbooks by Mihir Vatsa, Nandini Dhar, Usha Akella, Manjiri Indurkar and Arjun Rajendran were released through Vayavya and Aainanagar at an event ‘Reading Five: An Evening of Poetry’ at Moti Lal Nehru college. It was a refreshing visit, that took me back to my college days when we, as English students, sat wide eyed, aware of the privilege of having an author read their work to us.

The houses protrude from the hills like buck teeth.
But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.
They’re like leaves, competing for light.
I notice their stillness,
how they never shiver from the cold.
The windows rattle, I know, though I can’t hear them now,
but the wind could be mistaken for insects.
They eat similarly, perhaps.
I haven’t seen them copulating though –

our first phone was born with me,
my mother always said;
my first memory of distance also
comes from the phone.
my father, on a Friday, calls home
and tells me, “I cannot come
this Saturday.”
I am two. He is thirty nine.
What about Sunday?
“Not Sunday either, darling. I will
come next Saturday.”
I must have cried wanting to understand
what it meant: to hear a voice

I like country churches
While chicken play around in the porch,
on the steps sit little girls, passing their time picking lice
And almost always locked are those sacred chambers
in the holy presence
of drying bloody red chilies
Indolently swayed across the front, dried palm crosses
Resident in roof tiles are vagabond squirrels
The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger
is stretching itself towards the yellow star with blue dots

We first interviewed Sharanya Manivannan after the publication of her short story collection, The High Priestess Never Marries_. That interview can be read here. This interview was done in the light of her recent poetry collection,_ The Altar of the Only World.
**The world ‘Only’ in your title: should we pause on it? Sita, Inanna, Sita-Inanna – they reach the underworld in your poems. Yet this underworld is not the world being referred to as the only world, and is certainly not the world where the feast (let’s say the one in the poem ‘Benediction for the Feast’) eventually takes place.

Faiz, what befell the fellow travelers of late last night?

At an avant-garde café in uptown Pune,
the reserved tables celebrate
a teenager’s birthday in cosmopolitan English.
My nearly dead phone flares up with a call from home:
My mother laments in frayed Kashmiri:
_I am happy you aren’t home, two boys
were shot dead today.

An overturned anda-bhurji cart of a hawker during a riot.
She who had borrowed money to set up this stall
brought in twelve crates of eggs for the day,
freshly baked loafs of bread, 5 kilo onions wholesale
and few cheap refined-oil cans by selling
all the clothes she owns
except the sari that she now adorns.
Stocks of beedis lying on the ground;
awaiting whores

It was February when we wheeled my sister into the hospital, her eyes shut close with pain. There was always someone touching her hair, her hand, always someone telling her that it would be alright, everything would be fine, but also sobbing as they said it, while she drifted in and out of consciousness. The hospital was quiet, the nurses talked quietly. People waiting outside the ICU wore sweaters and caps in bright colors.

Aww! Sweet! That’s my boy. Kill. Kill. Kill…No, no, no… it’s pecking his eyes out… Yess! Grabbed it by the neck. Now one snap and the head’s off, rainbow neck and plumage an’ all. I think it’s time to land on the nearest branch. A few of my brothers might be on the lookout too. Best be the first off the block! I dip down, circling the topmost branches, looking for a sturdier lower branch to land on while keeping one wary eye on the prey, or, to be honest, on the severed head of the prey which the dog has very obligingly thrown aside while starting on the body.

Over a cup of chaha,
I stumbled over words
through a conversation
in a Marathi influenced by the American tongue.
My relatives and friends listened
their faces falling
and at that moment
in that conversation
the distance between us was much
further than that of the Atlantic Ocean.
I’ve picked up languages until now
as a consequence of picking up my life and placing it in lands where

When the phone doesn’t stop ringing,
I excuse myself from the meeting room;
watch the rain create a rhythm that fails
to touch me beyond the sound-proof glass
I have collected two seasons
since the last time you called
the tremble in your voice seeks familiarity
Konnichiwa you say in an uneasy whisper
language has abandoned your fingertips, alienated you,
your poems now merely mirror the mirage of colors, of shoes and booths,
