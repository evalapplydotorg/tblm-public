<section>
<p>An overturned anda-bhurji cart of a hawker during a riot.<br>
She who had borrowed money to set up this stall<br>
brought in twelve crates of eggs for the day,<br>
freshly baked loafs of bread, 5 kilo onions wholesale<br>
and few cheap refined-oil cans by selling<br>
all the clothes she owns<br>
except the sari that she now adorns.<br>
Stocks of beedis lying on the ground;<br>
awaiting whores<br>
for you to take a drag from your filthy mouths,<br>
trample them and walk away.<br>
Gutkha piles,<br>
carnations around the necks of messiahs, disowned.<br>
Those that fuck this democracy of yours every night,<br>
cheat on her in the day<br>
with their arson and might.<br>
Bourbon biscuits discarded in a corner<br>
like a river that has forgotten to flow with time.<br>
Distraught, given up on its fate.<br>
Just a damp marsh now, sludge.<br>
A single dangling lighter under the rubble<br>
limp like a penis<br>
that’s drained of all its cum.<br>
And haunted by the screams<br>
of that freely flowing gutter nearby<br>
running amok on charas<br>
from Kamathipura to GB road.<br>
The stench you breathe everyday<br>
en route to work.<br>
This air that stinks of potassium cyanide.<br>
That’s how the streets of my city look tonight.</p>
<p>An urchin hungry, feeding its dog<br>
flour mixed with water,<br>
some sugar and salt.<br>
And their snot and tears<br>
for garnishing and seasoning.<br>
This dish on their menu<br>
that doesn’t exist on any à la carte of yours.<br>
A trickle of sewage in the spring,<br>
An honest moan between all your screams.<br>
An uneasy itch<br>
between the damp folds of your thighs.<br>
What you suppress under the pleats of your fancy tights.<br>
And rabidly rub when the lights of your homes are out.<br>
Zombies on steroids,<br>
neatly dressed<br>
in their halter-ops and turtle-necks.<br>
Oblivious to the stench of sweat<br>
that drips onto the ground<br>
from the hairy armpits of Mathadi kamgaars<br>
who silently build roads and hoist your obscene towers.<br>
This city of dreams<br>
you walk on,<br>
dance on,<br>
piss on,<br>
fuck on,<br>
die on.<br>
A gecko’s tail, your existence<br>
shed yet wriggling<br>
dead yet alive.<br>
The sheer insignificance of the useless information you consume<br>
and the cookies you forget to delete every time.<br>
Until the system finally can’t take it anymore,<br>
stops responding<br>
and one day crashes down<br>
mid-sext.<br>
That’s how the streets of my city look tonight.</p>
<p>A massive oil spill in the Atlantic,<br>
one that’s red not blue.<br>
On skins that have been yoked<br>
like castrated bulls, burnt<br>
like heaps of cow dung to thatch<br>
the shiny walls of your homes.<br>
Go stand near those ceramic tiles.<br>
Inhale,<br>
tell me if they don’t smell like death.<br>
Take a breath deeper for each time<br>
you had done nothing but walked away.<br>
Caress those walls for each time<br>
you had been unmindful of your privilege,<br>
have said nothing about the religious criteria<br>
on those dumb-ass matrimonial websites.<br>
Kiss those walls, dry hump them<br>
for each time you misappropriated history,<br>
went by with your routine life…<br>
the lynchings and killings<br>
in the name of religion<br>
that you watched on prime-time<br>
as you nibbled tandoori chicken<br>
on another weekend eve.<br>
That gore which makes you tune into something else.<br>
Something that’s more ‘palatable’ and ‘fun.’<br>
All that blood and all those cries,<br>
such murderers of your appetite.<br>
A stand-up comedy or sports<br>
you’d prefer perhaps<br>
to unwind at the end of a long day,<br>
life is stressed out anyway.<br>
Give us some entertainment for the love of God!<br>
Or some poetry?<br>
No! No poetry, please.<br>
Poetry is such a bore, such a prude.<br>
A maiden who talks about death and dreams.<br>
Such a turn-off, no action,<br>
just a buzzkill.<br>
Makes one reflect, and that’s such a vice.</p>
<p>Whenever you discreetly outcasted that servant,<br>
his teacup always kept aside.<br>
whenever you didn’t squirm when you read about how it was back then.<br>
A mug hung around their necks<br>
like the curse of Ashwaththama,<br>
for them to spit in,<br>
for spit vile like an undead<br>
breathing eternally with no demise.<br>
And brooms around their waists<br>
like a thousand cacti have together bled.<br>
For their footprints cursed<br>
and hands meant only for dragging the dead.<br>
Eyes meant for not shedding tears<br>
until every eyelash stood burnt.<br>
But it was back then, no?<br>
Now? Look now everything is fine!<br>
Just one-off incidents.<br>
But those can happen anywhere,<br>
anytime.<br>
The crutches that we provided them with-<br>
weren’t those enough?<br>
These hapshis won’t ever be satisfied.<br>
So grab a knife and stab them all with it<br>
in one go.<br>
Then stab yourself.<br>
Make sure that the knife is rusted;<br>
that way if you don’t die from the wounds<br>
you certainly would from tetanus.<br>
Let’s just be doubly sure.</p>
<p>The point is to kill yourself before they outlive you.<br>
You don’t want to die at their hands<br>
when that happens.<br>
That would be such a disgrace.<br>
So go ahead, stab yourself with all your might<br>
for each time you read<br>
Plato, Camus, Sartre, Kafka, Baudelaire,<br>
Gorky, Kalidasa, Ambedkar, Dostevsky, Phule, Lenin, Marx, Che, Maykovsky, Neruda<br>
and didn’t think about the rules<br>
peeling the skin of a manual scavenger.<br>
Whenever you didn’t feel like<br>
opening the manholes of every sewer<br>
that exists in this godforsaken city of yours<br>
to fling everyone inside,<br>
then close it<br>
shut tightly with a giant boulder—<br>
a holy text with ancient relics.<br>
These demons, trap them all<br>
between the never ending cycle of life and death.<br>
They were never alive anyway.<br>
This moon of yours acts as a pimp now<br>
and whores your soul away every night.<br>
It’s about time you grabbed the moon by its collar<br>
and flushed it down the drain.<br>
Let there be no light.<br>
It’s about time you rubbed your<br>
cataract – laden eyes<br>
and saw this sinking ship<br>
we are all sailing in<br>
for what it is.<br>
All of us turning into savages,<br>
ravaging each others’ intestines.<br>
Ruptured, overflowing filth, bile<br>
potent enough to dissolve everything in its wake<br>
as it spreads across the entire continent.<br>
The ocean should now show us no respite.<br>
So hug the nearest corpse tightly tonight,<br>
sing it a lullaby by Begum Akhtar,<br>
if you can.<br>
Death by poetry just sounds so nice.<br>
Cry, scream, stab, break, rot, burn.<br>
A graveyard desecrated by gods.<br>
An eclipse fucked in the arse by the sun.<br>
That’s how the streets of my city look tonight.</p>
