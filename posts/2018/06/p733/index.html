<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plantation House</strong></p>
<p>Lazy heat on the veranda.<br>
Slow crawl of days. Time ripples<br>
like white veins through red marble.<br>
The ceiling fan slaps a devil mask</p>
<p>in beating shadows. The man reads<br>
a two-day-old Financial Times,<br>
taps ash from a cheroot. The woman<br>
wears a white dress and straw hat,</p>
<p>and the machete hacking foliage<br>
is the pulse in her breast.<br>
The library soundtrack hums<br>
with overloud cicadas</p>
<p>while the point of a dried leaf<br>
scrapes on chessboard tiles.<br>
Bird song is persistent, and choric.<br>
The camera performs a close up.</p>
<p>In the far trees, disgruntled monkeys<br>
plan a complex retribution<br>
for the mowing of the stately lawn.<br>
The owner is a Singaporean banker</p>
<p>but no one really belongs here<br>
except the house staff<br>
who pad through corridors<br>
lightly on bare feet.</p>
<p>They wait for the scene to play out<br>
with sly patience. They hold keys<br>
to all the rooms. The next guest<br>
will always look like you.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ornithology</strong></p>
<p>Like a fluid burst of a saxophone line<br>
skittering out of silence<br>
and syncopating emerald ash the spring<br>
of new wet wood the rash<br>
of orange mould on green bark<br>
the sprig of crimson flowers<br>
bursting at the tree line<br>
the sky beyond the mountains<br>
and scree-littered vistas<br>
the mist bleeding from the lake<br>
down into paddy fields<br>
where the men weave palm leaves<br>
into a roof for an outhouse</p>
<p>but we can also reclaim a habitat<br>
a pond a late spring<br>
some thirty years before<br>
my father bending to my shoulder<br>
pointing into grey sky as blue<br>
-edged wings hiccup<br>
on the upwards beat a flash<br>
of red at the hood and white at the breast<br>
a crest springing upwards to write</p>
<p>a perfect gift<br>
is to see a thing<br>
and name it.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Traffic</strong></p>
<p>Dawn and its white importunities:<br>
the soft cumulus of morning,<br>
a taxi hailed outside the hotel,<br>
the slender curve of the moon.</p>
<p>Rogue shapes glide above us<br>
bent as bows, solemn and assiduous,<br>
sliding over date palms, the tiles<br>
of flat roofs. We imagine them to be birds</p>
<p>but discover they are bats<br>
gliding on fanged wings<br>
in slow circulations, their eyes trained<br>
for mango and papaya pulp,</p>
<p>the juice of burst peaches.<br>
They skim like fleet fish,<br>
as we follow the route out of the city,<br>
past the closed up market stalls,</p>
<p>the paper factory, the stucco fort<br>
and dockyard development,<br>
a banana box wicket<br>
from a backstreet cricket match.</p>
<p>The bats are angels of our departure,<br>
surveying the walled gardens<br>
of the out-of-town development,<br>
the toll booth where traffic queues</p>
<p>wait for the absent attendant.<br>
Beside the dark motorway,<br>
gulls gather on a playing field<br>
ready to scatter as we drive on by.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bathing in Ella</strong></p>
<p>Steam is the dominion,<br>
the white blush<br>
against glass blurs</p>
<p>the mist beyond,<br>
erases mountains and<br>
finer intricacies of scrub:</p>
<p>a burst of date palms<br>
on the cliff edge<br>
is dissolved to spurts</p>
<p>of fading smoke<br>
a pure sublimation,<br>
chemical, diffused.</p>
<p>I sink<br>
deeper in the tub,<br>
plunge through water</p>
<p>the colour of red apple skins.<br>
Two thirds landscape,<br>
I embrace this surrender,</p>
<p>this womblike simmering,<br>
an absent heart of this<br>
deft disappearance,</p>
<p>a vague citizen of its empire<br>
only a knock<br>
at the door spins me back</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feathers</strong></p>
<p>Sylvia stayed reckless for beauty<br>
and fled to Malaga with a younger man,<br>
until disease called her homewards<br>
into cures and those recriminations<br>
that drift, circle, but never land.</p>
<p>Everyone spoke about her final walk:<br>
Hyde Park, late spring, a wagtail<br>
descending on her finger,<br>
illuminating in a photograph<br>
what people called her soul.</p>
<p>The family would be haunted by birds.<br>
Magpies, peacocks, pigeons,<br>
the strange omens of crows and ravens.<br>
The parrot, Priscilla, lost in Kuwait<br>
hastily renamed from Elvis</p>
<p>after they’d discovered its sex.<br>
Or the sister released to a coastal town<br>
by widowhood, who suspected<br>
that one beady-eyed gull<br>
was her husband, picking over her peace.</p>
<p>After Sylvia died, a robin<br>
invaded her daughter’s house<br>
to chirp news from the dead. Now,<br>
as we sit on a veranda, a wagtail<br>
escapes the egrets and barbets,</p>
<p>the mist of these foreign hills<br>
to spy on us with impertinence.<br>
‘Take a photo,’ her granddaughter says,<br>
because such visits are expected.<br>
‘It’s Sylvia, come back to say hello.’</p>
