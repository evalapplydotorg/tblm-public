<p>Over a cup of <em>chaha</em>,<br>
I stumbled over words<br>
through a conversation<br>
in a Marathi influenced by the American tongue.</p>
<p>My relatives and friends listened<br>
their faces falling<br>
and at that moment<br>
in that conversation<br>
the distance between us was much<br>
further than that of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>I’ve picked up languages until now<br>
as a consequence of picking up my life and placing it in lands where<br>
English rarely made an appearance.<br>
Once I landed in a place deep with melanin that looked best in<br>
the gold of the setting sun.<br>
Where bodies moved to the rhythm of vudu drums<br>
that beckoned the spirits to dance with them.</p>
<p><em>Mwen te aprann pale Kreyòl tankou moun yo<br>
nan peyi kote deyo mon gen mon.</em></p>
<p>I learnt to speak Creole like those in a country where<br>
(as the Haitians say to describe the endlessness of their injustices)<br>
there are mountains beyond mountains.</p>
<p>Another was a place soaked in wine.<br>
One that reverberated with the sound of heels tapping in time to flamenco.</p>
<p>_Allí yo aprendí a hablar español.<br>
_<br>
There I learnt to speak Spanish<br>
but not like the stunning men and women who made<br>
it sound so sultry.</p>
<p>I learnt those languages through love<br>
through dance and in the haze of drunken nights.<br>
I devoured their dictionaries and remembered<br>
the minuscule details of conversations held<br>
on the back of motorcycle taxis<br>
with my eyes staring at a sky that became less foreign each day.</p>
<p>My God, I miss those places<br>
even though my heritage has no trace there.<br>
We always crave things that are not already ours.</p>
<p>As a child, my parents insisted that I read Marathi fables<br>
recite the <em>barakhadi</em><br>
and write it all down.<br>
They insisted that I speak only in Marathi</p>
<p>and I?<br>
I responded in that immigrant kid kind of way.<br>
I didn’t want to learn Marathi</p>
<p>because its accent fell into my English one at school<br>
because at that age, language is fluid and does not understand separation<br>
and does not understand that in a white neighborhood<br>
my melanin did not mix well<br>
and neither did the slight slip of my tongue which was<br>
so accustomed to the spice tin in our kitchen.</p>
<p>So I refused to learn the one thing that was the entire purpose of my parents’ efforts.<br>
I refused to call my mother<br>
<em>aai</em>.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong.</p>
<p><em>Mala Marathi neet yeta, baraka.<br>
Mala Punyat ek varsha zalay.<br>
Aani thoda pan Marathi nai shikle ya velat tar magh kai upyog ithe rahilyacha?<br>
Thoda far shikliye</em></p>
<p>making up for all that lost time<br>
learning to <em>feel</em> in this language<br>
wrapping my tongue comfortably around the sounds<br>
that never make an appearance in English</p>
<p>as it is only through language that we can belong to a place</p>
<p>Over a cup of <em>chaha</em><br>
I remain a bit soft spoken<br>
but the words come to me, slowly, determined to be said properly.<br>
Relatives and friends lean in closer to hear me<br>
and they hold my hands in theirs and laugh<br>
celebrating that yes, I am learning<br>
about what is already mine.</p>
