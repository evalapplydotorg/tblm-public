<h2>Three Poems – by Rohith</h2>
<p><strong>Premonitions</strong></p>
<p>1</p>
<p>A white room with monitors<br>
an otherworldly space in winter<br>
I see you from the flip side<br>
of the soundproof glass-wall;<br>
tubes inserted from every side<br>
screens playing an unscripted<br>
language in motion.<br>
Your body is immobile – but your<br>
eyes, they dart in all directions<br>
in their yearning to remember –<br>
our eyes meet for a moment,<br>
I read the question inscribed<br>
in your glance – what if death<br>
actually means forgetting to live?</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>You are motionless on your bed-<br>
I try to wake you up; but your<br>
eyes are wide open. I know<br>
that a coldness entered your<br>
body – like a town taken over<br>
by a curfew on a winter night.<br>
I still believe that you remember.<br>
How can you forget me, after all,<br>
and leave these spaces to emptiness?<br>
How can you negate the meaning<br>
of our everlasting togetherness?<br>
Maybe you are still sleeping<br>
with your eyes open (why not!)<br>
and dreaming into your memories,<br>
going backwards in time.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I see you in a train window; you<br>
are leaving this town. You see me<br>
without guilt. I don’t want to know<br>
where you are going.<br>
I only hope you have a ticket.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**How to Score in a Small-Town<br>
**<br>
You have to find an alley invisible<br>
to the rest. It will be the most overlooked<br>
one, in a bustling centre. There, you’ll<br>
find a half-blind old man in the saffrons,<br>
sitting on the steps of an abandoned<br>
government building. He will be drinking<br>
tea; sit next to him and try to strike<br>
a conversation. He is cranky, he will<br>
scare you away, he will cuss you for being<br>
a horrible human being, he will say the<br>
meanest things about your existence,<br>
and eventually, he will open up to you.<br>
He will tell you about the news he read<br>
in the morning paper and then<br>
about his family. How his middle-<br>
aged daughter and her ill-minded<br>
husband are plotting to kick him<br>
out of his home. His wife died of cancer<br>
a few years ago, in the government<br>
hospital. He says life is an end to itself,<br>
that there’s no hell or heaven and<br>
death is the only thing he is waiting for.<br>
That’s when you tell him why you came<br>
and show him the money you have,<br>
ask ‘oka potlam’.</p>
<p>He will take it out and hand it over<br>
as you give him the crumbled notes, the<br>
only evidence of your identity, your life,<br>
in a town numbed with the high of reality.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>**Her Name<br>
**<br>
_for Maruj<br>
_<br>
1</p>
<p>Her name is a curfew<br>
in the night of a country;<br>
It’s the letter that writes itself<br>
in the hurry of turning into ashes.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>I try to hold on to her name<br>
every time I say it; it melts<br>
away into the history of nouns;<br>
a flake of ice on tongue.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>There are so many things we<br>
don’t notice in our lives.<br>
‘For instance’, I ask her, ‘where<br>
did the nails you bit off<br>
in the morning disappear?’</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Her silence is the gunshot<br>
fired at a distance.<br>
Her silence, the war ground<br>
many lovers died in the past.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>The words that fail reach her,<br>
they go astray in midair; They<br>
abandon meanings and become,<br>
winds in the night,<br>
chasing street dogs.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>“I am afraid of your absence”<br>
I say, loud enough for her to know<br>
what I mean. “Everyone goes<br>
missing in this country” she says.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>In the end, there’s a finitude.<br>
She says ‘Take care’ before<br>
dissolving into silence. I say,<br>
‘You too’ to her ghost.</p>
