<p>***</p>
<p>_I’m going to quit school and join the boy scouts.<br>
_<br>
He ran away when he was fifteen. The sleeper trains used to have green leather seats.<br>
The news flash read: <em>Traps are being laid to capture innocent animals and to enslave unsuspecting natives.</em></p>
<p>When the lodge owner asked for his address, he walked out.<br>
Outings during June were fantastic with a good strong swell and off shore winds. What more could we ask for?</p>
<p>The hotel owner said <em>we only offer room to married couples and families</em>, so we smiled and bought souvenirs. Mahabali offered his head and then the universe was consumed.</p>
<p>An “invincible man,” he is well loved as a god by the primitive tribes in the area.<br>
We drove past Koovathur twice, with him insisting all the while that <em>I would give my head to live in this plot of land someday.</em></p>
<p>Is Mahabali a real giant? Yes. He also eats babies.<br>
He admitted later that he’d been ready to work as a tea-boy near the station, as long as he did not have to pray on Fridays.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>_A job is what you do to get free time.<br>
_<br>
There are three ways of getting to T Nagar from Adyar.<br>
When I came to the city, the Greams Road Fruit Juice Shop had only one branch: on Greams Road.</p>
<p>During the evening shift, there was only one guard at the door. Nirmala and I called him <em>Nepali baiyya</em>, An essay to describe the non-dual transcendent basis of all existence.</p>
<p>When Mahabali returns, he will unseat Indra and turn the heavens over.<br>
Once, when I was walking back home, a man stopped his motorbike and said <em>Sit, baby. Want a ride?</em></p>
<p>I think of the power outages sometimes. We ate lots of Parle-G and wiped our foreheads with our dupattas. Indira the maid was really named after Indira Gandhi or perhaps she was herself sickly.</p>
<p>Our boss said they had struggled to emerge as the pioneer in industry and sugar cane plantations. And then it came to be that I always ordered the muskmelon special (without sugar).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>_It smells like family.<br>
_<br>
Appa goes for a walk every morning at six thirty. The house is required to smell like Lizol before he leaves. My neighbour has a dyslexic child. We played noughts and crosses.</p>
<p>Shiva holds the poison in his throat at Vellore. You can throw a coin into his mouth.<br>
The exhibits encourage the building of strong social skills by creating situations that require children to work as a team.</p>
<p>No membership is required and all bookings are confirmed and guaranteed at Vellore youth hostels. When we caught the watchman napping during a robbery, he said the saleswoman was nice to him.</p>
<p>My father spends Sundays counting all the loose change in the puja room. He plays Solitaire on the odd day.<br>
Most people use aluminum coins unless they want to get their children married, in which case, silver is used.</p>
<p>I asked Indra where she got her perfume from. She always replied, <em>oh, my him, you know</em>.<br>
When they shut off the power, I sat in the verandah making collect calls. Appa snored the whole time.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>_We will try not to smudge.<br>
_<br>
Our faces are painted in black kohl. We are lips, unlined.<br>
Aachi masala—presidency is situated here. It has the perfect blend of homely aroma, so the marriage stays alive.</p>
<p>I was at home with my grandmother when the woman selling condoms asked to see my husband. When Shakti revolted, Shiva destroyed her, because he was never one to stand disobedience.</p>
<p>I told her, <em>he is not here yet</em>. When my grandmother asked, I told her the woman was selling voltage adapters. She was reincarnated anyway, because single Gods upset cosmological hierarchies.</p>
<p>My grandmother replied, <em>so what? The tv screen always goes blank just when the heroine is getting married</em>. We could use them. Jalakantheshwara is a misnomer because Shiva’s throat was full of poison, not hydroelectric charge.</p>
<p>On my last date, a man pulled up next to the car and said we were indecent. My father, when told about the episode, said <em>these youngsters</em>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>_Are we like together?<br>
_<br>
When my mother called, she expressed disgust over the quality of hair products. <em>No wonder everyone is uncoupling.</em><br>
24X7 was running an interview about seed saving, cultural security, and economic insecurity in India denoting hope.</p>
<p>The inductive coupling process, the “antenna-like” circuits within, use an energy depleted world as their jumping off points. My aunt called in exactly ten minutes to show me profiles of Asterisk and Reliabil_Man on bharatmatrimony.</p>
<p>It is imperative to maintain a genealogy directory of well-known and not-so-well-known family names to record more hits.<br>
On the last date, he also assured me that the legality of non-matrimonial partnership would soon be validated by the judiciary.</p>
<p>Both Shakti and Aachi masalas are currently looking for a spice mixture that can be used to season anything, even milk bread. Yet, I met Asterisk because Amma insisted that investment bankers whose last name was Kumar <em>keep their hair as they age</em>.</p>
<p><em>Are you familiar with the trend of historical prices, historical volume, splits and dividends</em>, he asked.<br>
The Supreme Court ruled that conjugal relationships did not have room for questions in order to hold in a court of law.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>_Picked up.<br>
_<br>
The authentic market focuses on us following the threads of our inner impulses.<br>
Amma was horrified and kept saying that <em>looking on the internet doesn’t mean you should lie and make things up</em>.</p>
<p>I told the doctor that I had fallen off the scooter on the way back from a business meeting. He frowned. Brain imaging studies seem so simple and elegant: hook someone up to a functional MRI machine.</p>
<p>The first tv show I worked on was called <em>Business Hour</em>. Aachi’s tender quoted better prices and we sold our breaks to them. The MRI established that no serious injuries had been sustained. He kept frowning even then.</p>
<p>The imaging community has the best marketing exposure on the internet, coupled with color pictures of services and products. Before I resigned, Human Resources was circulating a memo that read: <em>Wanna do your part?</em></p>
<p>_We could use whatever you can afford in this tender start-up phase: Donate here. Then, stay in the loop with us here.<br>
_ Later, I overheard Dr. Kumar telling the intern: <em>I need to sneak away for a relaxing trip. I never meet single women with concussions.</em></p>
