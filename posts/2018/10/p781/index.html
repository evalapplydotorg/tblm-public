<p>_For Mama<br>
_<br>
***</p>
<p>Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow<br>
her and say, in English, <em>I miss the Arab<br>
fisherman from Marina beach terribly</em>.</p>
<p><em>The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish<br>
every Saturday was special</em>. She says<br>
in Konkani. <em>Dole pole</em>. She points</p>
<p>at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.<br>
<em>Stale. Should have gone early<br>
to the market</em>, she sighs,</p>
<p>her finger still pointing. <em>Never ever point.<br>
It is rude</em>. She had warned. I silence<br>
my upbringing and tell her about</p>
<p>my friend, in Konkani. Who was dumped<br>
for being Mangy. Immediately I translate<br>
it to English. She chops the head,</p>
<p>examines it closely. I have a feeling<br>
she will not go ahead with cooking it.<br>
To corroborate my story, I open Facebook</p>
<p>and point at a friend. <em>Her story</em>. I say.<br>
Fiction works any day. I think.<br>
<em>Close that thing. Concentrate!</em></p>
<p><em>Why do you run away?<br>
What is a girl without cooking?<br>
When will you even try?</em></p>
<p>I can’t tell her the only problem is<br>
the routine. She has painstakingly learnt<br>
authentic Mangalorean.</p>
<p>Cutting onions for the curry, Mom tells me<br>
she cried when I learnt the ABCD. Maybe<br>
<em>he</em> knew it would work. <em>Aun tuka mog karta</em></p>
<p>_<br>
_ <em>he</em> confessed one day. The only words<br>
in Konkani, <em>he</em> learnt to say. I cried<br>
and got carried away. Maybe <em>he</em> knew</p>
<p>it would work. The way the fisherman knew<br>
his shrimp. Second Saturday he was away,<br>
then the next, the next and the next.</p>
<p>I waited, trying to recreate<br>
the last time I saw him. He was…<br>
struggling with a fish in his grip.</p>
<p>He was good, I could tell<br>
from the size of his catch. Did he let go<br>
when I wasn’t looking? He must have</p>
<p>moved on to something better.<br>
Something lighter on the conscience.<br>
The fish is ready. We sit to eat.</p>
<p>We don’t talk when we eat.<br>
_Chew your food well.<br>
Beware. Bones!<br>
_</p>
<p><em>The eyes are the tastiest but this.<br>
Stale.</em> She says. <em>Oh, you don’t eat eyes!</em><br>
I put it in my mouth to prove her wrong.</p>
<p>I had given up eating eyes<br>
at ten. The grey stuff, soft<br>
and delicious, reminds me of</p>
<p>why I had stopped then.</p>
