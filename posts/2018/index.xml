1
A white room with monitors
an otherworldly space in winter
I see you from the flip side
of the soundproof glass-wall;
tubes inserted from every side
screens playing an unscripted
language in motion.
Your body is immobile – but your
eyes, they dart in all directions
in their yearning to remember –
our eyes meet for a moment,
I read the question inscribed
in your glance – what if death</description></item><item><title>Fish Eyes</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p781/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 11:08:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p781/</guid><description>_For Mama
_
***
Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow
her and say, in English, I miss the Arab
fisherman from Marina beach terribly.
The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish
every Saturday was special. She says
in Konkani. Dole pole. She points
at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.
Stale. Should have gone early
to the market, she sighs,
her finger still pointing.</description></item><item><title>Three Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p778/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 04:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p778/</guid><description>The poems can be read in their original format by clicking here</description></item><item><title>Picked Up Ghazals</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p768/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Oct 2018 03:31:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/10/p768/</guid><description>(To access the poem in its original format, please click here)

_I’m going to quit school and join the boy scouts.

He ran away when he was fifteen. The sleeper trains used to have green leather seats.
The news flash read: Traps are being laid to capture innocent animals and to enslave unsuspecting natives.
When the lodge owner asked for his address, he walked out.
Outings during June were fantastic with a good strong swell and off shore winds.</description></item><item><title>Four Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/07/p751/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jul 2018 06:40:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/07/p751/</guid><description>To preserve the format of these poems, we have made them available in a downloadable Pdf.

in Junglee, shouting ‘Yahoo’, they tell you it’s Kashmir

When Ranbir Kapoor climbs up the snow
in YJHD, all moon-struck, they tell you it’s Manali

So we’ve always got it wrong – grand-uncle or

Plantation House
Lazy heat on the veranda.
Slow crawl of days. Time ripples
like white veins through red marble.
The ceiling fan slaps a devil mask
in beating shadows. The man reads
a two-day-old Financial Times,
taps ash from a cheroot. The woman
wears a white dress and straw hat,</description></item><item><title>Another Earth</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/06/p731/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2018 03:07:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/06/p731/</guid><description>Distant memories approach me – I am looking in a water well, an elephant is plucking peepul leaves in the dense forest, and her mahout is laughing.
I am sprinting along narrow past-roads, fields of corns
and pulses covered in evening smoke,
the villages of many doors and windows.
It was my fifth grade when I saw a snake slithering in the harvested wheat field. A bare tree and its succulent drumsticks.</description></item><item><title>First Public Fighting, After Dark</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p726/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 12:03:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p726/</guid><description>i.
Almost always, I think of you fondly.
Like: clouds think of rain;
Like: words think of sentences;
Like: women think of orgasms.
ii.
But sometimes, dead
from the shoulders down
when we aggressively silently—Chomskily—
protest to one another: You’re wrong. You lie.
We wonder if others notice.
They must. Our animosity
obvious as the page of a second-hand Saramago
where the previous reader
had given up. A book
unhandled—the spine unbroken.</description></item><item><title>Review of Mihir Vatsa’s WINGMAN</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p723/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 11:43:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/05/p723/</guid><description>Recently, a combined bundle of chapbooks by Mihir Vatsa, Nandini Dhar, Usha Akella, Manjiri Indurkar and Arjun Rajendran were released through Vayavya and Aainanagar at an event ‘Reading Five: An Evening of Poetry’ at Moti Lal Nehru college.

But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.
They’re like leaves, competing for light.
I notice their stillness,
how they never shiver from the cold.
The windows rattle, I know, though I can’t hear them now,
but the wind could be mistaken for insects.
They eat similarly, perhaps.
I haven’t seen them copulating though –</description></item><item><title>Dear America</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/03/p706/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Mar 2018 05:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/03/p706/</guid><description>_(To listen to the poet read the poem, click here.)

our first phone was born with me,
my mother always said;
my first memory of distance also
comes from the phone.
my father, on a Friday, calls home
and tells me, “I cannot come
this Saturday.”
I am two. He is thirty nine.
What about Sunday?
“Not Sunday either, darling. I will
come next Saturday.”
I must have cried wanting to understand

While chicken play around in the porch,
on the steps sit little girls, passing their time picking lice
And almost always locked are those sacred chambers
in the holy presence

Indolently swayed across the front, dried palm crosses
Resident in roof tiles are vagabond squirrels
The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger
is stretching itself towards the yellow star with blue dots</description></item><item><title>Sharanya Manivannan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p687/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:37:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p687/</guid><description>We first interviewed Sharanya Manivannan after the publication of her short story collection, The High Priestess Never Marries_.

**The world ‘Only’ in your title: should we pause on it? Sita, Inanna, Sita-Inanna – they reach the underworld in your poems. Yet this underworld is not the world being referred to as the only world, and is certainly not the world where the feast (let’s say the one in the poem ‘Benediction for the Feast’) eventually takes place.</description></item><item><title>At the Cafés of Your Memory</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p676/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 13:37:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p676/</guid><description>Faiz, what befell the fellow travelers of late last night?

Faiz Ahmed Faiz
At an avant-garde café in uptown Pune,
the reserved tables celebrate
a teenager’s birthday in cosmopolitan English.
My nearly dead phone flares up with a call from home:
My mother laments in frayed Kashmiri:
_I am happy you aren’t home, two boys
were shot dead today.</description></item><item><title>//a mug hung around their necks like the curse of Ashwaththama//</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p673/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Feb 2018 13:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/02/p673/</guid><description>An overturned anda-bhurji cart of a hawker during a riot.
She who had borrowed money to set up this stall
brought in twelve crates of eggs for the day,
freshly baked loafs of bread, 5 kilo onions wholesale
and few cheap refined-oil cans by selling
all the clothes she owns
except the sari that she now adorns.
Stocks of beedis lying on the ground;
awaiting whores

Over a cup of chaha,
I stumbled over words
through a conversation
in a Marathi influenced by the American tongue.
My relatives and friends listened
their faces falling
and at that moment
in that conversation
the distance between us was much
further than that of the Atlantic Ocean.
I’ve picked up languages until now
as a consequence of picking up my life and placing it in lands where</description></item><item><title>Call From Kyoto</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/01/p648/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 02:44:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2018/01/p648/</guid><description>When the phone doesn’t stop ringing,
I excuse myself from the meeting room;
watch the rain create a rhythm that fails
to touch me beyond the sound-proof glass
I have collected two seasons
since the last time you called
the tremble in your voice seeks familiarity
Konnichiwa you say in an uneasy whisper
language has abandoned your fingertips, alienated you,
your poems now merely mirror the mirage of colors, of shoes and booths,</description></item></channel></rss>
