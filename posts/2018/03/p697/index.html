<h2>Church of Our Lady of Good Health – by Sabari Nathan (tr. Vivekanand Selvaraj)</h2>
<p>I like country churches<br>
While chicken play around in the porch,<br>
on the steps sit little girls, passing their time picking lice<br>
And almost always locked are those sacred chambers<br>
in the holy presence<br>
of drying bloody red chilies</p>
<p>Indolently swayed across the front, dried palm crosses<br>
Resident in roof tiles are vagabond squirrels<br>
The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger<br>
is stretching itself towards the yellow star with blue dots<br>
Nothing. no vaults, no festive lights no pews<br>
Just a few islands of light float on the cold brick floor</p>
<p>Old tiles require changing; the floor needs sweeping<br>
at least once a week. On blackout nights,<br>
just like all other houses, there too a famished candle shines feebly<br>
No one is giving darshan there. In his father’s house,<br>
as an unemployed graduate once-in-a-while<br>
running errands, with sisters at marriageable age— lives Jesus<br>
Mary, returning from tiring work in the woods, finishes her bath and sets out<br>
to get embers</p>
<p>Seems like it will rain</p>
