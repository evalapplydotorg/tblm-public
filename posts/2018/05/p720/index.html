<h2>Rongtong – by Sumana Roy</h2>
<p>The houses protrude from the hills like buck teeth.<br>
But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.<br>
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.<br>
They’re like leaves, competing for light.<br>
I notice their stillness,<br>
how they never shiver from the cold.<br>
The windows rattle, I know, though I can’t hear them now,<br>
but the wind could be mistaken for insects.<br>
They eat similarly, perhaps.<br>
I haven’t seen them copulating though –<br>
neither insects, nor the winds.<br>
Rongtong – it could be the name of an insect,<br>
one trapped in a jar, treating the glass as food.<br>
It could be the name of the wind too,<br>
the rhythm of advance and retreat. Rong Tong.</p>
<p>Hill Cart Road behaves like a priest, waiting for converts.<br>
I’ve stopped. The car is getting back its breath.<br>
The tyres are losing heat, regaining innocence.<br>
On the left are houses abandoned by children’s drawing books –<br>
triangles on squares, the eaves half-broken,<br>
as if erased by an absent-minded child.<br>
All houses are related, I know.<br>
Like men, like their hair and eyes,<br>
and how they shiver.<br>
The toy train passes by, its smoke a blob,<br>
like a soft-boiled egg that’s stuck to its chimney.<br>
It is serious about its slowness,<br>
as if that was its gift, like the sea is on a beach.<br>
I see it move away, like a language teacher in school,<br>
moving to another classroom.<br>
All that remains is the pram-like gesture of its wheels,<br>
the houses soaking that sound, muttering in echo.<br>
The road and the rail lines merge far away,<br>
like the buttocks of a wide-hipped woman<br>
that meet only in our mind.</p>
