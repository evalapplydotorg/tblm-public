<h2>Two poems – by Kuhu Joshi</h2>
<p><strong>The day of the fitting</strong></p>
<p>I enter the basement</p>
<p>of the Spinal Injuries Hospital. It is white,</p>
<p>walls and a bed and a curtain. Mom is holding my hand.</p>
<p>There is a doctor, also in white. He does not look at me. He says <em>namaste</em> to Mom.</p>
<p>He dips his hand into a tub of white liquid, pouring more white powder into it.</p>
<p><em>She will have to take her clothes off</em>, he says while mixing.</p>
<p>I am in blue bloomers and white baniyaan. <em>Keep this on</em>, Mom says inside my ears.</p>
<p>The doctor pulls open the curtain and points to a stool. I sit on it and he shuts out Mom.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, wet on my side-ribs, wet under my breasts, wet</p>
<p>under my armpits, wet on my abdomen. His hands are cold,</p>
<p>as they rub wet all over. He says, <em>keep your arms out to the side and stay still.</em></p>
<p>White liquid turns solid around my torso. I do not breathe from fear of cracking.</p>
<p>Mom is peeking through a gap in the curtain.</p>
<p>Next step, I am lying face-down on the white bed. The hands are messing</p>
<p>wet on my back ribs. I smell cement and Mom’s perfume.</p>
<p>I smell the doctor’s sweat as he moves.</p>
<p>I am a mummy, front and back. He takes a saw and I am alive.</p>
<p>He cuts open the plaster. I stand so he can take it off me.</p>
<p>In his hands, the skeleton of my body. In his hands</p>
<p>the silence of my spine, white and hollow. Mom is still standing.</p>
<p>And so am I.</p>
<p>Arms out, naked.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In this one you win</strong><br>
(For Mom)</p>
<p>In this one you are<br>
cutting squares out of blue fabric<br>
that you matched with my school dress.<br>
You are sewing up the edges.<br>
The doctor said 22 hours:<br>
one for bathing and one of my choosing.<br>
He gave us 2 hours outside the cage.</p>
<p>In this one I tell you<br>
I won’t go to school anymore.<br>
“You can’t make me.” I shut the door.<br>
I think a lot about the cold, wet plaster<br>
and the hands of the doctor<br>
moulding it around my waist.</p>
<p>In this one you are driving home the cage<br>
sitting next to me in the car<br>
and my tears in your rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>In this one you are showing me<br>
how to wrap the blue fabric on the iron ring.<br>
Soft cotton asking me to live.<br>
“It looks just like a scarf!”<br>
I think maybe it’s true. No one will know<br>
I have rods up my chest and back.</p>
<p>In this one you are sitting in the MRI room<br>
while I lie inside the machine.<br>
The car key flies from your hand<br>
and smacks the round giant.</p>
