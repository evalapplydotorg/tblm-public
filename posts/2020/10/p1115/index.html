<h2>Two poems – by Ashaq Hussain Parray</h2>
<p><strong>Home</strong></p>
<p>no one leaves home unless<br>
home is the mouth of a shark…<br>
—Warsen Shire</p>
<p>Home is an arrested metaphor<br>
suspended between my trust in clouds<br>
that shake their head when it rains<br>
and the news feed I scroll endlessly<br>
like my grandfather’s afternoon stroll<br>
down the abandoned lanes of faith.</p>
<p>Home is a suspected Kashmiri image<br>
under investigation of the security<br>
agencies that hang it upside down<br>
like an X-ray to look for the possible<br>
links of a deadly disease<br>
that might engulf the entire nation.</p>
<p>Home is a local ancient chinar tree<br>
that you write with your desires<br>
copied from the smiles of your ancestors<br>
slayed for saying what they preferred<br>
besides rice and potatoes on subsidized<br>
rates after years of organized Begar.</p>
<p>Home is a frozen smile that often plays<br>
on the silent lips of rebels buried alive<br>
under the weight of torched houses<br>
Abbu built inch by inch with mud and water<br>
borrowed from the fields through hours<br>
of toil and blood in mid-July.</p>
<p>Home is a <em>tschot</em> that <em>mouj</em> bakes<br>
on the ancestral hearth, her anchorage<br>
while she sings songs of Habba Khatoon;<br>
her cracked hands raise the dust of life<br>
lamenting the joys of youth and beauty<br>
before the muezzin’s call for prayer.</p>
<p>Home is the sky hanging above us<br>
where we fly our prayers before<br>
we expose our thoughts and heartbeat<br>
for regular security check-ups<br>
lest we plant the seeds of love and dreams<br>
and plead guilty of a conspiracy.</p>
<p>Home is a suspended hand of the clock<br>
gifted by my first love in high school<br>
that has given up the race for existence<br>
and adopted wilful ignorance of the time<br>
unless the soldiers knock down its walls<br>
for the last supper on its dead parts.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>

<p><strong>August 5, 2019</strong></p>
<p>That day, Allah’s kerosene lamp gaped<br>
during the great auction, while they sold us<br>
along with our old Imambarha at Budgam<br>
refusing to see our shaking heads;<br>
We carried history in small coffins<br>
on shoulders like our dead ancestors<br>
to bury in the soil of memory.<br>
The air was stiff with the traps of empire.<br>
We hung the night on our heads<br>
and shook its last dust particles angrily<br>
for a life that was our undoing;<br>
We stood curfewed and implored God;<br>
He had been a judge in his dream;<br>
we had Hazratbal outside our lawn<br>
we beseeched the saint to be with us:<br>
<em>At least you have seen our women<br>
Drying cow-dung and storing poplar leaves<br>
For the coming winter.</em><br>
He did not speak this time; he never did!<br>
when we took pilgrimage to caves on the hill<br>
God had melted into the polluted waters of Dal;<br>
At last, we visited Jesus at the Gulmarg church<br>
they had hanged him─ his body frozen in ice;<br>
That day, we did not believe our eyes;<br>
we ran short─ of miracles and communications,<br>
of Gods and the saints; we had silence in abundance<br>
while two babies were delivered together<br>
<em>Handcuffed to history</em><br>
their mothers gathered the colonial air<br>
in their cupped hands like the blessings of<br>
Shahe-i-Kirman and colonized them forever.</p>
