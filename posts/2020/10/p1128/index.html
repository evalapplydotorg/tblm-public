<h2>Library of Olan – by Prashant Parvataneni</h2>
<p><strong>Library of Olan</strong></p>
<p>The Library of Olan<br>
turned upside down<br>
when bombs of tear gas<br>
were thrown into its dusty rooms.</p>
<p>The intention was to smoke out<br>
those who refused to leave<br>
their obsession of biting into tomes,<br>
and licking the pages of ancient erotica.</p>
<p>To fill the library with tears,<br>
interrupt their exile with words,<br>
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,<br>
and corrupt the humor of books.</p>
<p>It is now a historical fact,<br>
that the opposite happened.</p>
<p>Books were now read<br>
with eyes full of tears.<br>
Words became mistier,<br>
sentences danced like waves,<br>
even scientific manuals<br>
carried the depth of rivers.</p>
<p>When the news went out,<br>
people in large numbers<br>
began migrating to Olan,<br>
queuing up outside the Library,<br>
to experience this altered state of emotion.</p>
<p>Inside the Library,<br>
one could sense at every turn of phrase,<br>
the entire weight of dialectical philosophy.<br>
The most basic comedies were laced<br>
with a tinge of melancholia.</p>
<p>Under the influence of artificial tears<br>
sentimental lyrics turned fraudulent.<br>
The longing to cry out of will<br>
and not force, mirrored<br>
the tragedy of star-crossed lovers.</p>
<p>In a state of deferred catharsis,<br>
Aristotle’s plot came undone –<br>
readers abandoned causal routes<br>
to wander in bylanes<br>
of unimportant scenes,<br>
and look for characters<br>
without arcs.</p>
<p>In the middle of a story,<br>
when people looked up<br>
to exchange glances,<br>
they silently compared<br>
the moistness of their hearts,<br>
and measured the intimate distance<br>
between their feet.</p>
<p>All the signboards were gone,<br>
strict instructions suspended –<br>
the Library kept sinking<br>
deeper and deeper<br>
into Silence.</p>
<p>Today, if you visit<br>
the Library of Olan,<br>
you’ll find carpets marked<br>
with traces of footsteps<br>
and bookshelves that didn’t rot,<br>
despite being so damp<br>
for so many years.</p>
<p>Today, if you turn<br>
the pages of any book,<br>
you will find your fingers<br>
running over printed words,<br>
but also, over patterns<br>
of fallen tears.</p>
