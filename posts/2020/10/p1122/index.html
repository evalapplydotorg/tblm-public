<h2>Three poems – by Beni Yanthan</h2>
<p><strong>Delicious Vowels</strong></p>
<p>This is how you sound.<br>
Like strips of<br>
indecipherable syllables<br>
floating inside a<br>
lullaby.<br>
This is how you taste.<br>
Like the first breath of air<br>
a drowning man sips<br>
when he is finally free<br>
of the echo of the sea.<br>
This is how you move.<br>
Like spoken-word poems<br>
that carry the finality<br>
of the written word in<br>
their voices.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Break, break, break.</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>You drink water from the earth,<br>
I drink the water of the sky.</p>
<p>You speak of wars and engines and empires,<br>
I speak of seas and stars and magnolias.</p>
<p>You were born at sunrise and made half-moons disappear,<br>
The night is my currency.</p>
<p>You were raised in the company of freizes that drew beautiful patterns<br>
on your face with the dye of fireflies,<br>
I carved the moon on the walls of my house,<br>
to placate the fears of scaredy cats.</p>
<p>Your ancestors worshipped porcelain goddesses,<br>
Mine snipped at rhododendrons and wore them as prized heirlooms.</p>
<p>Fragrant pears and softened almonds cured your hunger,<br>
The sprint of wolves quenched my thirst.</p>
<p>You create poems. You feed blushes.<br>
I beat them with my hands until their rhymes fall out.</p>
<p>Don’t hold your breath, knock yourself out.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dear Magnolia</strong></p>
<p>A man beats his wife<br>
Because he cannot beat his son,<br>
His son beats his wife,<br>
Because he cannot beat his father,<br>
Men revere each other<br>
By withdrawing into their women,<br>
And somewhere in city,<br>
Regret is peddled under neon lights,<br>
Where a torrent of giggles<br>
Finds the language it must speak.</p>
