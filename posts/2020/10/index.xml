The Library of Olan
turned upside down
when bombs of tear gas
were thrown into its dusty rooms.
The intention was to smoke out
those who refused to leave
their obsession of biting into tomes,
and licking the pages of ancient erotica.
To fill the library with tears,
interrupt their exile with words,
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,
and corrupt the humor of books.
It is now a historical fact,</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:26:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</guid><description>The day of the fitting
I enter the basement
of the Spinal Injuries Hospital. It is white,
walls and a bed and a curtain. Mom is holding my hand.
There is a doctor, also in white. He does not look at me. He says namaste to Mom.
He dips his hand into a tub of white liquid, pouring more white powder into it.
She will have to take her clothes off, he says while mixing.</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:23:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</guid><description>Delicious Vowels
This is how you sound.
Like strips of
indecipherable syllables
floating inside a
lullaby.
This is how you taste.
Like the first breath of air
a drowning man sips
when he is finally free
of the echo of the sea.
This is how you move.
Like spoken-word poems
that carry the finality
of the written word in
their voices.
Break, break, break.
It wasn’t meant to be.</description></item><item><title>Postmortem</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:21:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</guid><description>Postmortem
Listen: imagine your
body next to mine.
Think of the knife
that drew my thin spine
open. I am in a room
so cold and lonely
like the slow negative
of a stone breaking
into water. One evening
I asked you how to die
this slow: smooth, bent
along the edges of my grave.
Almost losing my way back home.

On the heels of the siren
A hissing undertow
Back-bending sea-oats
Palm fronds frisked
Static in the aquarium
White knuckles on the horizon surely
higher than our roof
Horseshoes hung down on the beach
Will cavalry recede
_
_ Between magnet shore and magnet moon
Won’t ocean float
Sorry fish so sorry garden
A fist mounted the ocean and scrawled on the promenade:
Equality
No Souvenir</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1115/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:16:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1115/</guid><description>Home
no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark…
—Warsen Shire
Home is an arrested metaphor
suspended between my trust in clouds
that shake their head when it rains
and the news feed I scroll endlessly
like my grandfather’s afternoon stroll
down the abandoned lanes of faith.
Home is a suspected Kashmiri image
under investigation of the security
agencies that hang it upside down
like an X-ray to look for the possible</description></item></channel></rss>
