Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle. Time and again, this table has witnessed the unbecoming of a story, or a moment becoming untraceable—you leaning against the wall, exhaling portions of nostalgia as the window tries to fathom every possible shape of departure.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Satya Dash</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:09:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</guid><description>(To preserve the format of the poems, we have made them available in a PDF document.

(A reflection of Zubair Ahmed’s poem of the same name)
Sometimes during quiet summer
afternoons when everyone is
asleep, I sit at your desk.
They took away your half
of the bunk-bed anyway.
Aai still calls your name
in our empty house
and Papa sits very still.
I think he pretends
not to be listening for you.
Sometimes I will look down
and imagine I am you instead</description></item></channel></rss>
