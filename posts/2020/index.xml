Black spiders in my woodpile
asterisk a sharp distinction
between their brisk compaction
and the expansive human view.
These spiders aren’t the toxic
species that gleam in cellars
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.
They’re only shy little blobs
dedicated to devouring gnats.
Splitting oak and maple to burn
on spangled winter nights, I brush
these tiny creatures to safety
without damaging their many
but necessary legs.</description></item><item><title>Library of Olan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1128/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:27:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1128/</guid><description>Library of Olan
The Library of Olan
turned upside down
when bombs of tear gas
were thrown into its dusty rooms.
The intention was to smoke out
those who refused to leave
their obsession of biting into tomes,
and licking the pages of ancient erotica.
To fill the library with tears,
interrupt their exile with words,
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,
and corrupt the humor of books.
It is now a historical fact,</description></item><item><title>Two poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:26:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</guid><description>The day of the fitting
I enter the basement
of the Spinal Injuries Hospital. It is white,
walls and a bed and a curtain. Mom is holding my hand.
There is a doctor, also in white. He does not look at me. He says namaste to Mom.
He dips his hand into a tub of white liquid, pouring more white powder into it.
She will have to take her clothes off, he says while mixing.</description></item><item><title>Three poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:23:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</guid><description>Delicious Vowels
This is how you sound.
Like strips of
indecipherable syllables
floating inside a
lullaby.
This is how you taste.
Like the first breath of air
a drowning man sips
when he is finally free
of the echo of the sea.
This is how you move.
Like spoken-word poems
that carry the finality
of the written word in
their voices.
Break, break, break.
It wasn’t meant to be.</description></item><item><title>Postmortem</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:21:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</guid><description>Postmortem
Listen: imagine your
body next to mine.
Think of the knife
that drew my thin spine
open. I am in a room
so cold and lonely
like the slow negative
of a stone breaking
into water. One evening
I asked you how to die
this slow: smooth, bent
along the edges of my grave.
Almost losing my way back home.

On the heels of the siren
A hissing undertow
Back-bending sea-oats
Palm fronds frisked
Static in the aquarium
White knuckles on the horizon surely
higher than our roof
Horseshoes hung down on the beach
Will cavalry recede

_ Between magnet shore and magnet moon
Won’t ocean float
Sorry fish so sorry garden
A fist mounted the ocean and scrawled on the promenade:

no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark…
—Warsen Shire
Home is an arrested metaphor
suspended between my trust in clouds
that shake their head when it rains
and the news feed I scroll endlessly
like my grandfather’s afternoon stroll
down the abandoned lanes of faith.
Home is a suspected Kashmiri image
under investigation of the security
agencies that hang it upside down
like an X-ray to look for the possible</description></item><item><title>Fairytale</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1106/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 03:12:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1106/</guid><description>Fairytale
The princess is nagging
The frog to sing
Before a kiss
“Are you kidding me” he says
I have nothing for nose
Nothing like an Adams apple
Saying this, he spits on her face
And she turns into a cricket
Burdened with a broken violin
Together they are now the greatest
Band of the night in swamps
He is croaking notes while she
Rubs her hairy legs

Fight or Flight
The amygdala is a small part of your
brain that assesses threat, and sets your
fight or flight response in motion.
When the threat passes though, the amygdala
calms down and so does your body.
However, what do you do when your amygdala</description></item><item><title>A Woolly Mammoth on the Shore</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1096/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 02:56:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1096/</guid><description>To preserve the formatting, the poem has been made available in PDF.

A stray thought enters my head
and ambles across
with the nonchalance of cattle
let loose by their owner
to wreak havoc on the neighbour’s farm.
It tramples all other thoughts,
and bites off some more
that have managed to grow
in the crevices of my skull
– like plants sprouting out of fantastic ruins.
I move to the window
to spit out the unwanted guest
but stop at the sight</description></item><item><title>Dead Actors</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1065/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 01:07:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1065/</guid><description>Dead Actors
Dead actors keep appearing on TV,
no older than the morning bread.
As if the episode had only been shot
yesterday;
its movements,
oeuvre, talking points
saved in memory’s freezer
without remembering
it’s 2019 already.
Chief Inspector Morse is nineteen years gone.
But Chief Inspector Morse has died
before my eyes.
His drinking, cynical, wandering
selfish days
took a pounding; threw him down
as a termitic tree/tipping water glass</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1059/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 02:47:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1059/</guid><description>a’ dèanamh air an t-Seapan

One is as old as the days they remember.
Some make us age quicker, better.
Some slow in pace: something between a wish
and a prayer, something
that is both. Some call it hope. It’s not.
Light sweeping the white sand, across
the cool and quiet sea. Here, his consoling hand
on my face; fast arriving, a withered brow,
reaching, touching,
brown, low.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1050/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:12:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1050/</guid><description>Erosion

Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle. Time and again, this table has witnessed the unbecoming of a story, or a moment becoming untraceable—you leaning against the wall, exhaling portions of nostalgia as the window tries to fathom every possible shape of departure.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:09:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</guid><description>(To preserve the format of the poems, we have made them available in a PDF document.

(A reflection of Zubair Ahmed’s poem of the same name)
Sometimes during quiet summer
afternoons when everyone is
asleep, I sit at your desk.
They took away your half
of the bunk-bed anyway.
Aai still calls your name
in our empty house
and Papa sits very still.
I think he pretends
not to be listening for you.
Sometimes I will look down
and imagine I am you instead</description></item><item><title>Urvashi Bahuguna</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p960/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 04:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p960/</guid><description>Terrarium opens on a poem about girls who “had the world at the instep of their sole”, encouraged to run like they mean it by Mr. Joseph, who treated them like he did the boys. It seems to capture so much about what this collection is about: girls and women, connection to the (literal, muddy) earth, the speed and sudden shifts in life’s trajectories. It’s also about a specific person, a teacher, and the effect he had on these girls.</description></item><item><title>Three prose poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p958/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 03:49:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p958/</guid><description>Living a dog’s life
On the day of Divasi amavasya, Amma breaks a thumri on the transistor, fetches some fresh mud near the tulsi plant with a girl child’s innocence. She makes two idols — Shiva and Parvati — faceless, crude, even genderless. She empties a bowl of coconut oil on my head, saying that my head is hot, and scrubs it with shikakai she has brought all the way from Bangalore.</description></item></channel></rss>
