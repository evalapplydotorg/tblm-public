— Sharanya Manivannan, Conchology
That evening, the sun was slow to set, the sky cloudless, and the moon—eager. And so it loomed, amid the soft contrails left behind by the airplanes on the gentle azure sky, early and agog: that paperwhite moon. I came with my eighteen-year-old kohl-smudged eyes to see you.</description></item><item><title>Still Water – by Akhilesh</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1147/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 06:46:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/12/p1147/</guid><description>We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world

Black spiders in my woodpile
asterisk a sharp distinction
between their brisk compaction
and the expansive human view.
These spiders aren’t the toxic
species that gleam in cellars
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.
They’re only shy little blobs
dedicated to devouring gnats.
Splitting oak and maple to burn
on spangled winter nights, I brush
these tiny creatures to safety
without damaging their many
but necessary legs.</description></item><item><title>Library of Olan – by Prashant Parvataneni</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1128/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:27:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1128/</guid><description>Library of Olan
The Library of Olan
turned upside down
when bombs of tear gas
were thrown into its dusty rooms.
The intention was to smoke out
those who refused to leave
their obsession of biting into tomes,
and licking the pages of ancient erotica.
To fill the library with tears,
interrupt their exile with words,
dampen the pleasures of marginalia,
and corrupt the humor of books.
It is now a historical fact,</description></item><item><title>Two poems – by Kuhu Joshi</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:26:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1126/</guid><description>The day of the fitting
I enter the basement
of the Spinal Injuries Hospital. It is white,
walls and a bed and a curtain. Mom is holding my hand.
There is a doctor, also in white. He does not look at me. He says namaste to Mom.
He dips his hand into a tub of white liquid, pouring more white powder into it.
She will have to take her clothes off, he says while mixing.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Beni Yanthan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:23:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1122/</guid><description>Delicious Vowels
This is how you sound.
Like strips of
indecipherable syllables
floating inside a
lullaby.
This is how you taste.
Like the first breath of air
a drowning man sips
when he is finally free
of the echo of the sea.
This is how you move.
Like spoken-word poems
that carry the finality
of the written word in
their voices.
Break, break, break.
It wasn’t meant to be.</description></item><item><title>Postmortem – by Devanshi Khetarpal</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:21:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/10/p1120/</guid><description>Postmortem
Listen: imagine your
body next to mine.
Think of the knife
that drew my thin spine
open. I am in a room
so cold and lonely
like the slow negative
of a stone breaking
into water. One evening
I asked you how to die
this slow: smooth, bent
along the edges of my grave.
Almost losing my way back home.

On the heels of the siren

Sorry fish so sorry garden

no one leaves home unless
home is the mouth of a shark…
—Warsen Shire
Home is an arrested metaphor
suspended between my trust in clouds
that shake their head when it rains
and the news feed I scroll endlessly
like my grandfather’s afternoon stroll
down the abandoned lanes of faith.
Home is a suspected Kashmiri image
under investigation of the security
agencies that hang it upside down

The princess is nagging
The frog to sing
Before a kiss
“Are you kidding me” he says
I have nothing for nose
Nothing like an Adams apple
Saying this, he spits on her face
And she turns into a cricket
Burdened with a broken violin
Together they are now the greatest
Band of the night in swamps
He is croaking notes while she
Rubs her hairy legs

Fight or Flight
The amygdala is a small part of your
brain that assesses threat, and sets your
fight or flight response in motion.
When the threat passes though, the amygdala
calms down and so does your body.
However, what do you do when your amygdala</description></item><item><title>A Woolly Mammoth on the Shore – by Aswin Vijayan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1096/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2020 02:56:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/07/p1096/</guid><description>To preserve the formatting, the poem has been made available in PDF.

A stray thought enters my head
and ambles across
with the nonchalance of cattle
let loose by their owner
to wreak havoc on the neighbour’s farm.
It tramples all other thoughts,
and bites off some more
that have managed to grow
in the crevices of my skull
– like plants sprouting out of fantastic ruins.
I move to the window
to spit out the unwanted guest
but stop at the sight</description></item><item><title>Master Ji’s Family – by Younis Kaloo</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1082/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:07:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1082/</guid><description>Men, young and old, have just begun to leave their houses after hearing a familiar voice coming from the loudspeakers of the grand mosque. They have been told to gather in Narbal’s Eidgah, a huge plot of land at a stone’s throw from the Srinagar-Gulmarg highway used only for special occasions such as marriages, funerals, Eid congregational prayers and, as in this case, an assembly for listening to ‘patriotic’ sermons of high-ranking army officials while their men carried door-to-door searches in the village with the help of helpless local boys.</description></item><item><title>Bad People – by Abbas Bagasrawala</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1080/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Jun 2020 03:04:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/06/p1080/</guid><description>‘So have you ever walked in on your mother touching herself’?
I hollered through the pistachio-colored door of the bathroom as I dicky-ed around in the medicinal cabinet and in the laundry basket hoping to find something incriminatory, or personal, that might limn precious information about whether or not my friend’s mother was looking for some young gun to rock her world. I was just killing time waiting for the flush tank to refill so as to complete the double tap on it, in the manner of the British Secret Services, after what was quite an extraordinary shit.</description></item><item><title>Dead Actors – by Arun Paria</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1065/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 01:07:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1065/</guid><description>Dead Actors
Dead actors keep appearing on TV,
no older than the morning bread.
As if the episode had only been shot
yesterday;
its movements,
oeuvre, talking points
saved in memory’s freezer
without remembering
it’s 2019 already.
Chief Inspector Morse is nineteen years gone.
But Chief Inspector Morse has died
before my eyes.
His drinking, cynical, wandering
selfish days
took a pounding; threw him down

One is as old as the days they remember.
Some make us age quicker, better.
Some slow in pace: something between a wish

that is both. Some call it hope. It’s not.

Eviction
And so it begins, the slow and weary process of eviction. Names, faces, sounds, facades, all stacked up like souvenirs waiting for their turn, hoping to survive another cycle. Time and again, this table has witnessed the unbecoming of a story, or a moment becoming untraceable—you leaning against the wall, exhaling portions of nostalgia as the window tries to fathom every possible shape of departure.</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Satya Dash</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 06:09:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/03/p1046/</guid><description>(To preserve the format of the poems, we have made them available in a PDF document.

(A reflection of Zubair Ahmed’s poem of the same name)
Sometimes during quiet summer
afternoons when everyone is

They took away your half

in our empty house
and Papa sits very still.
I think he pretends
not to be listening for you.
Sometimes I will look down

All them, underground savages, crawled down to depths of upto 4000ft. in the abandoned mine, northern panhandle, Western Meghalaya, through labyrinthine passages dug with basic mining implements—shovels, hammers, pickaxes, and chisels.

The cursor blinks in apathy. Hot white lights; cold steel trolleys gliding across the polished marble floor in clean diagonals like a carrom board. The lobby swallows sober men infected with orderly panic. There’s a high roof but no room for talk. Some men disappear behind the revolving glass door that creaks in protest every time a person enters. The slight swirl fills the lobby up with a smell Shibani knows too well.</description></item><item><title>Urvashi Bahuguna – interviewed by Sharanya Manivannan</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p960/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2020 04:05:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/01/p960/</guid><description>Terrarium opens on a poem about girls who “had the world at the instep of their sole”, encouraged to run like they mean it by Mr. Joseph, who treated them like he did the boys.
