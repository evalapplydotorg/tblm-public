<p><strong>Fight or Flight</strong></p>
<p>The amygdala is a small part of your<br>
brain that assesses threat, and sets your<br>
fight or flight response in motion.<br>
When the threat passes though, the amygdala<br>
calms down and so does your body.<br>
However, what do you do when your amygdala<br>
can’t calm down? When the threat never passes?<br>
It happens more often than you can<br>
imagine, that your brain constantly fires stress<br>
signals, and you respond to them, like a gunshot<br>
survivor who ducks under the table at the sound<br>
of a car backfire. Or a rape survivor who shudders<br>
even at a gentle touch.</p>
<p>The medicines you take can slower your<br>
responses, but I have got some bad news<br>
for you, friends. They don’t let you<br>
take in the love you’ve been seeking<br>
post that traumatic episode which<br>
always feels current, you’d think they added<br>
the ‘post’ as a joke. Some mental health<br>
humor for those in need of it.</p>
<p>Of the many maladies I suffer from, my favourite<br>
has to be anxiety. The jokes that come with it<br>
are precious. This one liner<br>
for example: <em>I have an anxiety disorder,<br>
which means my anxiety orders dis and dat.</em><br>
People with anxiety are the real<br>
humourists, they can appreciate every<br>
big and small, every dis and dat life hands them.<br>
The rest of the world is just faking it.</p>
<p>But I digress. Let me get back to the real<br>
reason why I am here, why anyone of us<br>
is here, reading this poem, writing it<br>
as we go. The real reason to write a poem,<br>
says a friend, is to find love, like it is the<br>
most profound discovery of the<br>
post-postmodernist era. And perhaps it is.<br>
With all the ailments the 21st century has<br>
given us, love does sit forgotten, somewhere,<br>
though always thought about. As we inch closer<br>
to the all-consuming darkness of our depressions,<br>
love could save us. If only we could recognize<br>
it, if only our amygdala would stop firing<br>
stress signals, telling us how every news<br>
is bad news. How every dis and dat requires<br>
a fight or a flight.</p>
<p>The road to recovery, says my therapist,<br>
is filled with traffic signals. You<br>
have to stop at the red light whenever<br>
your amygdala takes its flight of fancy.<br>
If you break the signals, you may<br>
never make it out alive, the post of your post<br>
traumatic reality may never get past you.<br>
As I begin to panic again, she looks at me,<br>
smiles and cracks a stale but funny joke.<br>
<em>How many psychiatrists, she asks, does it take to<br>
change a light bulb?</em><br>
When I don’t respond, she says,<br>
<em>only one, if the light bulb is willing to change.</em></p>
