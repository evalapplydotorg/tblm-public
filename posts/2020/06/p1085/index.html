<p><strong>Stray</strong></p>
<p>A stray thought enters my head<br>
and ambles across<br>
with the nonchalance of cattle<br>
let loose by their owner<br>
to wreak havoc on the neighbour’s farm.</p>
<p>It tramples all other thoughts,<br>
and bites off some more<br>
that have managed to grow<br>
in the crevices of my skull<br>
– like plants sprouting out of fantastic ruins.</p>
<p>I move to the window<br>
to spit out the unwanted guest<br>
but stop at the sight<br>
of a lady in green:<br>
swinging her hips, singing her ware.</p>
<p>Do they still exchange old clothes for new vessels?</p>
<p>My thoughts are like old clothes:<br>
torn, tattered, faded. Would I barter them<br>
for new ones like the sparkling stainless steel boxes<br>
inside which your fine reflection waits<br>
to snare you, trap you in its embrace for posterity?</p>
<p>I dig out a saree -my wedding attire-<br>
and place it in front of her. She inspects<br>
every inch and smiles. “Perfect . . . no holes!”<br>
she says, handing me a box that reflects<br>
the splendour of her paan-stained lips. I laugh.</p>
<p>The holes are in my heart, not in the six yards of red cloth.</p>
<p>A dog cranes his neck towards me<br>
trying to read my thoughts. I look away.<br>
With an angry growl, he runs into my thoughts<br>
chases away the cattle and wrests control of the field.<br>
“Chal hat!” I yell, my eyes glowering.</p>
<p>The dog drops down my head<br>
and walks out my mouth<br>
but not before sniffing out<br>
my most secret thoughts<br>
and lapping them up with his sordid pink tongue.</p>
<p>Furious, I trap him<br>
in my newly acquired box<br>
and stow it away in the same corner<br>
that had housed my saree<br>
these last thirty years.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The House they Sold</strong></p>
<p>Sell it! They chorused<br>
and it was sold. Just like that.<br>
A hundred years of history<br>
-held not by lime and mortar<br>
but by a billion stories-<br>
waits to be erased. The dust</p>
<p>that rises as I step in<br>
is not just any dust; each speck<br>
is steeped in ecstasy, tragedy,<br>
drama and absurdity<br>
or the intricate mundaneness<br>
of everyday living.</p>
<p>I fill a jar with that dust and shut it tight.</p>
<p>A jar full of ghosts: I place it<br>
under the open skies<br>
to see the specks waltz<br>
under the harsh afternoon sun<br>
and float dreamily<br>
under the moonlight.</p>
<p>I pull out two chairs<br>
-one for me, one<br>
for the ghost of my ancestor.<br>
Together, we survey the remains<br>
of a time buried under a heap<br>
of putrid memories.</p>
<p>I ask her the secret of her longevity.</p>
<p>She answers through the fruit-bats<br>
that have made home in the dark attics<br>
and the termites that have eaten through<br>
the teakwood floorboards<br>
and the rats that have secretly copulated<br>
and populated the basement.</p>
<p>What is family?<br>
The blood that runs through my veins<br>
is not my own, it is the DNA of ancestors<br>
blended and pureed into a fine chutney.<br>
Are my thoughts my own thoughts?<br>
Life goes on. Life moves</p>
<p>out of one house, into another,<br>
then another . . . a wandering nomad.<br>
Should a house hold on to you<br>
with puppet strings<br>
or you, the house?</p>
