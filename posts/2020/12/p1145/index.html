<p><strong>Thanks to Jonathan Edwards</strong></p>
<p>Black spiders in my woodpile<br>
asterisk a sharp distinction<br>
between their brisk compaction<br>
and the expansive human view.<br>
These spiders aren’t the toxic<br>
species that gleam in cellars<br>
or crawl into children’s bunk beds.<br>
They’re only shy little blobs<br>
dedicated to devouring gnats.</p>
<p>Splitting oak and maple to burn<br>
on spangled winter nights, I brush<br>
these tiny creatures to safety<br>
without damaging their many<br>
but necessary legs. The image<br>
of a spider in a candle flame,<br>
thanks to Jonathan Edwards,<br>
has cursed literate New England<br>
for almost three hundred years.</p>
<p>I’d like to spider myself off<br>
to fresh quarters, new horizons,<br>
more limber self-expressions.<br>
If I could do it by compressing<br>
myself into an iota<br>
of punctuation I surely would.<br>
But my hulking muddle of flesh<br>
has committed itself to culture<br>
rather than nature, shriving itself<br>
of several vital dimensions<br>
that neither ink on paper<br>
nor the digital screen can display.</p>
<p>The rumble of the gas engine,<br>
the sheer of splitting firewood,<br>
the muscle of piling the product<br>
belong to the great world of work<br>
that every creature inhabits.<br>
But my daydreams of spiderhood<br>
empowered by simple purpose<br>
lilt into the stratosphere<br>
like so many runaway blimps.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Everyone Seen in Profile</strong></p>
<p>Do you believe that the heft<br>
of our village keeps us happy?</p>
<p>Excess weight flattens landscapes<br>
and ruins laws of perspective.</p>
<p>Our former police chief pushes<br>
a belly as blunt as Moby-Dick.</p>
<p>A neighbor’s car squeals in its springs<br>
as she plumps into the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>We’re so bored with ourselves we eat<br>
objects of clashing colors</p>
<p>as if nutrition weren’t the issue.<br>
How long will drought and disease</p>
<p>edge us into private places<br>
where it’s hard to cast a shadow?</p>
<p>Why don’t the thin men of Haddam<br>
respond to our bleating and sighs?</p>
<p>When winter arrives, we’ll stand around<br>
drinking coffee in snowdrifts.</p>
<p>Unsafe to step indoors where<br>
viral thoughts linger long after</p>
<p>the subject has become a verb.<br>
For now, the autumn wind teases</p>
<p>with a moveable sterile field<br>
in which we enjoy our morning snack.</p>
<p>Eventually the town will collapse<br>
under the excess of its populace.</p>
<p>The river, astringent with drought,<br>
will equivocate for awhile.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Morning Melody</strong></p>
<p>The light breaks into pieces small<br>
enough to swallow. This happens<br>
daily, but who notices? Lines<br>
of force stretch like kite strings.<br>
You expect me to do something<br>
with my hands, but arthritis<br>
has rendered them crude as paddles.</p>
<p>Let’s go downtown and drown<br>
our quarrels in large paper cups<br>
of high-acid java brewed<br>
to flush sinkers fried in deep<br>
fat fryers no one ever cleans.<br>
Fueled by this gastric adventure,<br>
we’ll face a full day of errands<br>
and shuck the scholarly ambitions<br>
that aroused us in our youth.</p>
<p>What good did all that scribbling<br>
on notecards do? Remember<br>
the abstractions of Derrida,<br>
Bachelard, Empson, Hegel?<br>
We dragged their books to the landfill<br>
years ago, purging our senses.</p>
<p>Now we live on the ignorant edge<br>
where the wind brawls from the south.<br>
Our angle of vision excludes<br>
the darker sides of planets<br>
that dangle in the night sky<br>
like demented Christmas ornaments.</p>
<p>No wonder the light seems fractured<br>
along those emphatic lines of force.<br>
Morning coffee usually comforts<br>
and heals the worst of our sins.<br>
But today the news is so bad<br>
the headlines kill even casual<br>
readers with stark efficiency.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll stay home and listen<br>
for mice in the walls. Come outside<br>
and examine the world. The wreckage<br>
of last night’s freight of dreams lies<br>
rusting in the garden where<br>
we’re likely to trip over it,<br>
sprawling on our Mother Earth.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Esthétique des Odeurs</strong></p>
<p>The dog has smelled everything,<br>
but not this. He recoils and plops<br>
droopy on the sidewalk, nonplussed.<br>
You laugh at his muddled expression,<br>
but something in terminal decay,<br>
if that’s what he thinks he’s sensing,<br>
troubles instinct and evolution.</p>
<p>Dogs are entitled to meditate<br>
on any odor they choose,<br>
usually preferring the fetid—<br>
but this defies meditation.<br>
You wonder if some political<br>
object passed, rubbing its thighs<br>
on the fence, leaving a spoor<br>
to attract the opposite sex.</p>
<p>“What sex is the opposite<br>
of politics,” I ask. You sigh,<br>
“the absence of sex and also<br>
the afterglow of fantasy sex.”<br>
The smell must be powerful enough<br>
to smelt all smells into one.<br>
The dog no longer works his nose—</p>
<p>some knowledge is best left unknown.<br>
Dogs admire the fragrance of death,<br>
rolling in carcasses to hide<br>
their own smell from enemies.<br>
Color-blind, they find color<br>
in the fourth dimension where scent<br>
becomes bravura of rhetoric.</p>
<p>You wish you could nose out crimes<br>
among our little coterie<br>
of town officials, lawyers, cops.<br>
I agree that the local riffraff<br>
offers a world of rotten objects<br>
we trod upon daily, soiling<br>
our shoes but offering subjects<br>
and verbs we can manipulate.</p>
<p>Despite what our favorite poet claims,<br>
evil lacks an aesthetic other<br>
than a range of bouquets a French<br>
parfumier would love to catch.<br>
The dog smelled something stronger,<br>
richer and more frightening<br>
than the usual bundle of sins.</p>
<p>You examine the fence. Nothing<br>
but a slight gray stain as if<br>
some aged person had shed<br>
a year or two in passing. I kneel<br>
in the grass and touch the spot.<br>
I can’t smell it, but its texture<br>
is rough as the tongue of a cat.</p>
<p>The dog growls. He objects to<br>
further inquiry. The sun occludes<br>
itself, tucked into cloud. You bark<br>
a warning, but the moment passes,<br>
and you and I and the dog look<br>
ashamed for fussing over<br>
some lunatic notion long past.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Dogs Have Learned to Talk</strong></p>
<p>All the dogs have learned to talk.<br>
They’re discussing the rising cost<br>
and poor ingredients of pet food.<br>
They won’t speak to their owners,<br>
but when I ask a passing boxer<br>
his name, he replies, “Aloysius.”</p>
<p>You’re undisturbed by this glib<br>
new phenomenon. Perched<br>
on a metal chair on the lawn<br>
before the bookstore, you indulge<br>
your bitter appetite, preferring<br>
a lumpy scone to conversation.</p>
<p>Do you think that public discourse<br>
has gone to the dogs? October<br>
is almost here, your favorite month.<br>
I had hoped we would hike in hills<br>
of seasonal flamboyance, shedding<br>
the bulge of a summer of leisure.</p>
<p>I had hoped that some great logic<br>
would empower us when alone<br>
with vees of geese honking overhead.<br>
The dogs talk so loudly no one<br>
merely human can interrupt.<br>
Although leashed to their masters,</p>
<p>the dogs have seized control without<br>
a hint of violence. Their diction<br>
is perfect, their sense of the bon mot<br>
enviable. Finish your scone<br>
and allow me a sip of your coffee.<br>
I hope that when we get home</p>
<p>our cats remain as wordless<br>
and private as always. I wish<br>
I could emulate their stance<br>
despite the oceans of language<br>
heaving between us, between us<br>
and whatever’s about to evolve.</p>
