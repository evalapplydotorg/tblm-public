<p><strong>Dead Actors</strong></p>
<p>Dead actors keep appearing on TV,<br>
no older than the morning bread.<br>
As if the episode had only been shot<br>
yesterday;<br>
its movements,<br>
oeuvre, talking points<br>
saved in memory’s freezer<br>
without remembering<br>
it’s 2019 already.<br>
Chief Inspector Morse is nineteen years gone.</p>
<p>But Chief Inspector Morse has died<br>
before my eyes.<br>
His drinking, cynical, wandering<br>
selfish days<br>
took a pounding; threw him down<br>
as a termitic tree/tipping water glass<br>
on grass,<br>
in Oxford. I saw how heroes fall, disappear.<br>
Inspector Lewis: I was as sad<br>
to let him go. But I was in Pune. Helpless.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>In Cambridge, Amartya Sen is writing memoirs.<br>
At eighty-five, he’s ancient like a Betamax spool. The forefront man<br>
conceding to iPhone-toting-Instagram-flaunting<br>
children while the day brings bad news at 8 PM,<br>
on TV.<br>
With warnings<br>
and a trumpet sound. And then the day is gone.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is suspect after that. Everything is unclear.<br>
Hanging a net over the bed I ask myself<br>
who had more valour: M K Gandhi or Subhas C Bose?<br>
Who drove the Wanderer and who threw the Viceroy away from home.<br>
Who built the roof, who kept the fire burning<br>
all these years.<br>
Who made us see order, colours, destiny’s heartless laugh; beside whose statue we build<br>
a staircase even taller, to garland the man.<br>
Or a woman. Or a cow. Or a Garud. Or a pussy cat.<br>
On whose dream we make a thousand You Tube videos, that we half-watch<br>
but do not forget to like.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>My grandfather’s brother: a 1942’s mark on the back of his palm.<br>
A cut made by a whip. The whip that was a stingray’s tail: the stingray, a fisherman’s catch.<br>
The fisherman, a gaunt hunter of the sea, knew (in his fury), the Bay of Bengal didn’t have a match.<br>
‘Who wielded it, Dadu? Was it a bad white man?’<br>
‘No, no. It was a native. An Inspector. He lived only an hour’s walk from us.<br>
In 1947 he retired.<br>
His son opened a grocery shop at the school bazaar in 1957. His grandson is a teacher now. Would you like to be a teacher when you grow up?’</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The kingdom of yawn has come. We don’t know who we love and who loves us in return. What we want, what makes us.<br>
In doubt, in debt, in distress. Always, always. From the periphery we dance. On the fillets of emoticons. Heart, heart, heart. Hug, hug, hug.<br>
High five.<br>
Sparkling dust, unicorn, a school girl jump.<br>
Tantrums made with thumbs.<br>
With Salome’s ambition. In the palace of Tinder-Grinder-Bumble. To the last moans of love.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder how I will die. A curiosity, an anticipation may be. Peeking the end before toiling the preface, middle.<br>
Although a story of a death is only a story- an abstraction. Will my death be an abstraction too –<br>
to my departing, vanishing mind?</p>
