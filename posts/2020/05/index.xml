Dead actors keep appearing on TV,
no older than the morning bread.
As if the episode had only been shot
yesterday;
its movements,
oeuvre, talking points
saved in memory’s freezer
without remembering
it’s 2019 already.
Chief Inspector Morse is nineteen years gone.
But Chief Inspector Morse has died
before my eyes.
His drinking, cynical, wandering
selfish days
took a pounding; threw him down
as a termitic tree/tipping water glass</description></item><item><title>Two Poems – by Kevin MacNeil</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1059/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 02:47:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1059/</guid><description>a’ dèanamh air an t-Seapan
’is mise an t-amadan
a’ reic bùrn ri taobh na h-aibhne
is mise a’ ghlaoic a tha seasamh
ri taobh a’ bhodach-ròcais
cò ach dearg amadan
a shireadh an inntinn aige
air taobh thall an t-saoghail?
ach nach eil blas mì-bhlasta a’ bhùirn
air tighinn air a’ bheatha seo?
nach eil m’ inntinn fhein
na bodach-ròcais?
stiall ort, a phleuna bhuaireasaich,
tha bliadhnaichean ann
on a chunnaic an duine falamh seo</description></item><item><title>Three Poems – by Medha Singh</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1057/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 May 2020 02:29:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2020/05/p1057/</guid><description>I Hear Father is Dead in Another Country
One is as old as the days they remember.
Some make us age quicker, better.
Some slow in pace: something between a wish
and a prayer, something
that is both. Some call it hope. It’s not.
Light sweeping the white sand, across
the cool and quiet sea. Here, his consoling hand
on my face; fast arriving, a withered brow,
reaching, touching,
brown, low.</description></item></channel></rss>
