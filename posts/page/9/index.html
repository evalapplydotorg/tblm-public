When S first walked into the room, I took her for a woman around the age of fifty. Later, when I told her that, she said she would have preferred to look younger, like her younger sister who people said looked at least a decade younger than her actual age. She also clarified that I had not offended her. After all, she had always believed she looked older, much older than her age —a seventy-year-old?

_For Mama
_
***
Mom and I talk in the kitchen only. I follow
her and say, in English, I miss the Arab
fisherman from Marina beach terribly.
The joy in your eyes when he caught a fish
every Saturday was special. She says
in Konkani. Dole pole. She points
at the fish eyes. I search for solidarity.
Stale. Should have gone early
to the market, she sighs,
her finger still pointing.

_I’m going to quit school and join the boy scouts.

He ran away when he was fifteen. The sleeper trains used to have green leather seats.
The news flash read: Traps are being laid to capture innocent animals and to enslave unsuspecting natives.
When the lodge owner asked for his address, he walked out.
Outings during June were fantastic with a good strong swell and off shore winds.

**When Shammi Kapoor slides down the snow
**
in Junglee, shouting ‘Yahoo’, they tell you it’s Kashmir
but it is actually Kufri, near Shimla.
When Ranbir Kapoor climbs up the snow
in YJHD, all moon-struck, they tell you it’s Manali
but it is actually Gulmarg, in Kashmir.
So we’ve always got it wrong – grand-uncle or
grand-nephew – and we’ve been like this for long, always
Kashmir without Kashmiris, all for a song.

If you’re wondering who we are, let me unravel the mystery. We are the untethered children of those that live rich, tethered lives. Filled with reckless desire, unlimited ambition and thriving delusions. The unwilling bearer of it all? The place we grew up in and never grew out of – Roseburn – the perfect little island, surrounded by The City on all sides. It has everything. High-rises, row-houses, commercial blocks filled with multi-national corporations, comedy-clubs, jazz clubs, chain restaurants, local haunts, internationally recognised educational institutions, a massive hospital and a few hundred medical clinics serving the people and pets of.

Every morning Joan and Gilly wake up before their children do, set the house and day in order, settle down in the balcony with two cups of tea and a newspaper. Joan cuts a loaf of bread and a pair of tomatoes – do tomatoes come in pairs? she wonders – takes the chutney from the big fridge in the small kitchen and places it all on the table where they eat.

Plantation House
Lazy heat on the veranda.
Slow crawl of days. Time ripples
like white veins through red marble.
The ceiling fan slaps a devil mask
in beating shadows. The man reads
a two-day-old Financial Times,
taps ash from a cheroot. The woman
wears a white dress and straw hat,

Distant memories approach me – I am looking in a water well, an elephant is plucking peepul leaves in the dense forest, and her mahout is laughing.
I am sprinting along narrow past-roads, fields of corns
and pulses covered in evening smoke,
the villages of many doors and windows.
It was my fifth grade when I saw a snake slithering in the harvested wheat field. A bare tree and its succulent drumsticks.
