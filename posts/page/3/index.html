Once upon a routine death,
February snow wears a cold night
in its cataracted eyes, and sets out to meet
fellow occupants of fresh obituaries in stale newspapers.
Obituaries
That seek asylum from winter drought
in lost samovars of salted tea served with warm butter
at funerals of young militants to thirsty mourners.
Thirsty mourners
sit across each other in saffron tents
and lay bets on the average velocity of new guns

If my clothes get torn, I mend them
If soiled, I wash them
If I find no clothes
I will walk nude like you, Akka, but
How do I wash the dirt on a dress not worn?
If my sandal’s straps come undone, I’ll repair them
Left with a single shoe, will put it away
I could even cross the thorny, stony paths barefoot, but
If the path begins to devour the feet, Akka

Crenulated by ancient toil this
wall of sand stands against
the sky and stretches. At night it
turns homely: restaurants light
up its alleys. We get drunk on
its shrunken size and our
escape from the guide’s
intoning of its history.
Especially
the slave chambers, ferret
holes in which they were
shoved, stacked and sold –
on which Khiva thrived
for centuries. The cages
aren’t empty but thick
with pleading eyes

Sunday
Sunlight and anxiolytic flora
drink themselves silly;
an eastern pinch of sky blurts
like it forgot to take its pills.
The worm has wept
all Sunday while you were
reading the newspaper.
Of watering the taste of a fleck
of midnight fruit between your teeth.
Of the hummingbird, disturbed
by the sound of hideous undressing,
again leaving the portrait
of uncut happiness
unfinished in the whorl.
Mist rises toward

Have you ever tried
to slip out of your skin?
Not in the way
that means sad girls
and nights of warped mirrors
shoulders shrugging into themselves—
this is not a poem about my body.
Can a poem secede from
the hands that write it?
I am welded to myself,
to my ones and zeros and chipping
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—
of stepping out of flesh
without anything hanging

The tea cup has broken
in the shape of your lip –
the way people break
when nudged by grief.
The ink has spilled near the pocket
in the shape of a territory –
the stain stays –
the way an occupier does.
The paperback has dog eared
around the edges –
the way Time arrives
as a wave.
The mirror has splintered
into fragments –
the way autumnal leaves crunch

Puro was about to leave for the fields when she said to Jangir, “Will you come with me? I’ll give you laddoos to eat.”
Jangir had been playing with a soapnut in the lane. He swept up the soapnut, put it in his pocket and set off with Puro.
Puro was a young jat girl who danced the giddha and who, while playing on the swing, always soared higher than anyone else.

Learning Malayalam
Manjadithara, Puthupally, 1982
അ
On the layer of sand
that my forefinger parts, the curvaceous overture
begins to reveal an elephant in a
line drawing.
I taste succulent jungle grass.
Say, if I held the shell
of the first alphabet close to my ear,
would it be
a tribute to the mammal’s memory—
something I need
to embark on a journey of language?

In innocence, I saw only

The Drunkard of Pattinson Rd.
On the radio, something from the 1950s.
You know immediately when something’s from
the 1950s—the hesitancy of voice, the ire
of age; the innocence, nothing more than
a photograph wrapped in quatrain, left
to the whims of verses dipped in fire.
In a city, its eyes the roar of minarets,
I try and trace the passage of love. Lafz,
spoken and swallowed by air or left behind

Back then Papa and I would hop across rocks and boulders along the Tirthan River every morning, with our fishing rods in hand—he had a sleek fly rod and I had an amateur’s spinner. He had just started me on fishing, and we did our lessons before I walked with Madhu to school.
A week had gone by and there were no wriggling trout at the end of my line; just soaking shoelaces and rags, dripping twigs and brambles, things Tirthan River wanted out of its water.
