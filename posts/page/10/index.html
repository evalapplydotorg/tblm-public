i.
Almost always, I think of you fondly.
Like: clouds think of rain;
Like: words think of sentences;
Like: women think of orgasms.
ii.
But sometimes, dead
from the shoulders down
when we aggressively silently—Chomskily—
protest to one another: You’re wrong. You lie.
We wonder if others notice.
They must. Our animosity
obvious as the page of a second-hand Saramago
where the previous reader
had given up. A book
unhandled—the spine unbroken.

Recently, a combined bundle of chapbooks by Mihir Vatsa, Nandini Dhar, Usha Akella, Manjiri Indurkar and Arjun Rajendran were released through Vayavya and Aainanagar at an event ‘Reading Five: An Evening of Poetry’ at Moti Lal Nehru college. It was a refreshing visit, that took me back to my college days when we, as English students, sat wide eyed, aware of the privilege of having an author read their work to us.

The houses protrude from the hills like buck teeth.
But this is no mouth. It’s like Siliguri’s rolled-up sleeve.
Pink, yellow, anaemic blue – the houses, the molars.
They’re like leaves, competing for light.
I notice their stillness,
how they never shiver from the cold.
The windows rattle, I know, though I can’t hear them now,
but the wind could be mistaken for insects.
They eat similarly, perhaps.
I haven’t seen them copulating though –

Aye, we’re jist a wee country,
But we’re a wee country wi a big hert,

Stormed intae a schuil gym
An shot dead 16 bairns an their teacher,
Oor hert wis broken.
Nuthin we cuid dae wid bring the wee yins back,

our first phone was born with me,
my mother always said;
my first memory of distance also
comes from the phone.
my father, on a Friday, calls home
and tells me, “I cannot come
this Saturday.”
I am two. He is thirty nine.
What about Sunday?
“Not Sunday either, darling. I will
come next Saturday.”
I must have cried wanting to understand
what it meant: to hear a voice

I like country churches
While chicken play around in the porch,
on the steps sit little girls, passing their time picking lice
And almost always locked are those sacred chambers
in the holy presence
of drying bloody red chilies
Indolently swayed across the front, dried palm crosses
Resident in roof tiles are vagabond squirrels
The white cat that nestled its kitten in last year’s manger
is stretching itself towards the yellow star with blue dots

We first interviewed Sharanya Manivannan after the publication of her short story collection, The High Priestess Never Marries_. That interview can be read here. This interview was done in the light of her recent poetry collection,_ The Altar of the Only World.
**The world ‘Only’ in your title: should we pause on it? Sita, Inanna, Sita-Inanna – they reach the underworld in your poems. Yet this underworld is not the world being referred to as the only world, and is certainly not the world where the feast (let’s say the one in the poem ‘Benediction for the Feast’) eventually takes place.

Faiz, what befell the fellow travelers of late last night?
Where did the morning breeze halt?
Where did morning alight?
Faiz Ahmed Faiz
At an avant-garde café in uptown Pune,
the reserved tables celebrate
a teenager’s birthday in cosmopolitan English.
My nearly dead phone flares up with a call from home:
My mother laments in frayed Kashmiri:
_I am happy you aren’t home, two boys
were shot dead today.

An overturned anda-bhurji cart of a hawker during a riot.
She who had borrowed money to set up this stall
brought in twelve crates of eggs for the day,
freshly baked loafs of bread, 5 kilo onions wholesale
and few cheap refined-oil cans by selling
all the clothes she owns
except the sari that she now adorns.
Stocks of beedis lying on the ground;
awaiting whores
for you to take a drag from your filthy mouths,

It was February when we wheeled my sister into the hospital, her eyes shut close with pain. There was always someone touching her hair, her hand, always someone telling her that it would be alright, everything would be fine, but also sobbing as they said it, while she drifted in and out of consciousness. The hospital was quiet, the nurses talked quietly. People waiting outside the ICU wore sweaters and caps in bright colors.
