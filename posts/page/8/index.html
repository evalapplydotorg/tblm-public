At an almost-dawn one February, I
tell you how my parents had
almost named me after a
Mahadevi Verma poetry
collection
(twice)
निहार(इका)। नीरजा
before the Russians
invaded the familial
decision-making, and
I was christened
Никита| Nikita
“Funny how poetry finds
ways of coming back“, I chime.
Like Gulzar and so many
others, I want to write
a poem on that precise
moment when one falls in
love with their first names for

sky train
it’s difficult to say what
we are fleeing: the city is far
below. on the front seat, people
read or sleep, their faces suggest
peace. but something dark curls
around my shoulders.
blue must be the colour
of fear. this is my precipice
of impressions – twirling tree-
tops, billboards. yesterday
on the chao praya
the poised buddhas
contemplated tourists and yachts.
fear speeded up wears a mask

CALANGUTE
For R.D: In memoriam
On the beach, wind-blown tendrils of yellow gritty sand:
reminiscent of the joss sticks garlanding your photograph
with their tremulous, teary smoke and sickly-sweet fragrance.
My five-year-old son decides to delve deep into my past.
Hoping to excavate oysters from this Goa beach,
he exhumes boyhood memories instead
from this monsoon seascape of exile and grief.
No pearls here, not even a seashell.
His cache is bathetic: Pepsi and 7Up bottle caps,

Cabbage Moth
Mother is watching a video about raagi
flour and how to knead her way into father’s
heart. I’m sure it’s why she makes gooseberry pickles now.
I am reading about sloth bears eating mahua flowers.
My mind, matryoshka doll-like, forgets things.
I am mouthing “ursine”, “scat”, “crepuscular” so
I will remember to tell him. I forget.
The woman in the video is talking about buttermilk
and consistency and taste.

From a schoolgirl’s diary
On Saturdays I went to Buddha’s house
where he sat in lotus position, eyes closed,
filling the circular room that was earth,
his conical head touching the arched sky.
Saturday was holiday for school. Papa would
be at his office. Mama was always absent;
she was in Dubai nursing an Arab’s girl.
On Saturdays my home was a silent cave
except for a drone rising from nowhere.

Salt
Mother thunders into the kitchen,
a banished witch reclaiming her place
amidst the arcane, and tips
half a jar of salt into the rice
like she tipped over the wardrobe
earlier, her rage untrammelled by grey pills
or Godrej steel. ‘Choril uppilla,’ she chants,
her abrupt fury terrifying my cousin,
whose perfectly-cooked rice has now been
salted beyond salvation.
It is only years later I understand the ire,
the ignominy of under-salted rice.

**“After all, Punjabi is spoken on both sides of the border, divided only by the script”~
**
This is the splintering. This is the passport
which still reads Lahore,
India. This is also the indiscretion. What
no scrubbing can erase, for the way
sameness seeps through cracks and
makes itself known. To speak my father’s
tongue is to be absent. It is to wash one’s
hair with unknown waters and allow

Premonitions
1
A white room with monitors
an otherworldly space in winter
I see you from the flip side
of the soundproof glass-wall;
tubes inserted from every side
screens playing an unscripted
language in motion.
Your body is immobile – but your
eyes, they dart in all directions
in their yearning to remember –
our eyes meet for a moment,
I read the question inscribed
in your glance – what if death

Tuesday was a typical London day, which is to say, gray and wet. Fairchild Fortesque chose to walk the three blocks from The Victoria Hotel to the Bull Horn Pub, and by the time he stepped into the darkness, wished to hell he’d worn his raincoat. “Who knew a drizzle would turn into a deluge?” he asked the doorman.
“Only the British,” was the dry reply.
Fairchild admired laconic staff people.
