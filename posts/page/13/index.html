Contrary to popular belief, the biggest enemy of rain is not the rapid felling of trees. Nor is it rising global temperatures, industrialization, the burning of fossil fuels or even that telltale hole in the sky. The single biggest enemy of rain is a person by the name of Gopi and he still lives in our little town and he still hates rain.
We would sit on a parapet by a small creek, a group of us younger old men and Gopi, who was old enough to be reborn a toddler.

You cannot believe it is time for her to leave. Fifteen years. Really?
You were only ten when she started working for your family, probably her first expat family. She had worked for local families before yours, you know. She seemed like every other nanny your parents had hired, when she worked only part-time. Only later did you start appreciating her, when she lived with you.
You have been in the company of nannies much longer than you have been with your parents, so you know you can differentiate between the good ones and the bad ones.

**Sally on Tambourine
**
I taught Sally how to hit her tambourine on 2 and 4. So many pink people hit on 1 and 3. And she could sing like birds: like nightingale, like whippoorwill, like western meadowlark, her voice so pure, like dawn-light, like twilight, like golden vegas, streams of light, golden fingers from the clouds. She sang for God; she sang for the group. Our praise band met Thursday nights up near the altar at the church.

**Notes on Arun Sagar’s Anamnesia
**
Arun’s Sagar’s debut collection of poems, Anamnesia, opens with the image of a lake. At the end of the poem, the narrator, overwhelmed by ‘the ache/of vistas’ and much like the empty ‘concrete bowl’ before him, waits eagerly and with peaceful resignation—in his case, for a flood of memories and sensory impressions (‘Beginnings’). Reading through the collection, the reader becomes witness to a ‘jagged summer rain’ of diverse sights, sounds and images.

**First of all, let me congratulate you on compiling a collection of short stories. It is still a beautiful moment when a writer makes their debut.Your collection, ‘Transit for Beginners,’ due in March 2016, contains stories that you’ve placed in various litmags in India and outside. We are happy to inform our readers that the collection includes two stories that first appeared in TBLM; one of them is the story that gives the book its title.

नज़्म लिखो , बेशुमार लिखो
पर उससे बदलाव की उम्मीद मत रखो
तुम्हे लगेगा तुमने बड़ी बात कह दी है
तुमने ही अगली क्रांति की नीव रख दी है
बस तुम्हारी इस नज़्म से अंधकार जल जाएगा
और अगले ही दिन सब बदल जाएगा
ये बातें बेशक सच्ची नहीं है,
और ये ग़लतफ़हमी भी अच्छी नहीं है
तुम्हारी नज़्म किसी पर्वत पे मामूली चोट की तरह है
किसी विशाल लोकतंत्र के एक वोट की तरह है

She says nothing, and how.
The radio plays a dirge
for December. Then when walking
was going from verse to worse
in the hay of our years, she infiltrated
the moonlight in my beers. My toothpaste
wasted on her charcoal lips.
The things I could do were few
and the things I couldn’t fewer.
The drugged street lamps; the lost
rickshaws in their long slumber. Now
she extends herself like a theorem

Her period refused to come. She lay in turmoil beneath the ineffectual ceiling fan. No position brought relief from the heat. After days of tossing and turning and lying in limp sheets, her shoulders and her buttocks were disfigured by the blemishes served up by prickly heat, and the monsoon was still an age away.
Clans of mosquitoes infested the room, convening under the bed, as well as in the adjoining bathroom, where you took your pants down at your peril.

When Colonel Aravindan Nair took him out back to the great grounds bordering his rubber estate, Panikker assumed that it was to show him the site of the prospective wedding. He expected the Colonel to stretch his brawny arms and say, ‘A tent this big’ or stomp his foot and proclaim, ‘lunch for a thousand guests here, there a podium, and of course, changing areas! – and all this depends on you, Panikker.

(A reimagining of a day in the life of Vincent van Gogh)
My dear Theo…
The moon shines with a vengeance tonight, dear brother, but no I must not worry you. Yes, it sounds lovely, and I have always loved words. The sound they make. Like wind chimes, the rustle of wheat fields, the ripple of… ripples, words, the moon looks curiously on at me as if I knew her secrets, do you remember as boys you once tore off the kitchen linen, the screeching noise it made, no not that sound no anything but that oh what have I said?
