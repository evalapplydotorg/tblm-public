My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</description></item><item><title>Universe on a Banana Leaf – by Sumit Shetty</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 05:01:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1337/</guid><description>There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Karan Kapoor</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:56:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1333/</guid><description>Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Kathleen Bryson</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 04:49:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/10/p1331/</guid><description>First Person

Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature.

This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and

Our first years together were all sex and electric conversation. She was in her goth phase then, her eyes lined with kohl that shone like hot tar, and she wore dark maroon lipstick. “Oxblood,” she said when I asked her what it was called. “Rad… won’t you wear pink once in a while?” She rolled her eyes.
Oh, how I craved her!</description></item><item><title>Grin and Bear It – by Neha Negi</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 06:07:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/08/p1278/</guid><description>The arctic waves lap over me, freezing the blood in my veins. Shame ushers in a memory of shame. The snapping strap of my bathing suit – shame – my incipient breast sliding out – it grips me – the horror and the shame. Shame is a hirsute monster lurking in the depths; slaying it was my salvation.
It can be cold within these walls, painted with tears, vomit, and blood.</description></item><item><title>Two poems – by Sambhu R.</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1260/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:17:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1260/</guid><description>Omphalophobia
“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch</description></item><item><title>Two poems – by Kenneth Pobo</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jun 2021 04:14:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/06/p1257/</guid><description>Petaled Geography
We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us
each morning. Orange, a song
which they will teach us. Mexico
on a thick stalk.

amnesia is an attic full of salvation,
a tainted spine brewing soft waters into memory.
you speak a language recently forgotten,
of sentences reeking of mason jars and tombstones;
weaving a sister tongue of lost identity
I often wonder if you remember how warm figs taste like, or the scent of sour raisins staining your shoulder,

Tending to me
like a page from her Koran,

Nine minutes of complete attention.
Every stem, every root, every bend.
She bends on me like a lover, a mother, a devotee.
Stretching? she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,

Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.</description></item><item><title>Three poems – by Aekta Khubchandani</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2021 01:34:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2021/05/p1219/</guid><description>How to know that you’re new to New York
The mailman is your friend now. His wife and you both practice yoga. She’s into hot yoga, you’re following the Iyengar school. He, the mailman and you are both happy about this conversation.

in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,
with slurries, and piss, dour hiking trips to the ravine.
Man on the bridge: You’re not welcome here.
Bring immigration papers—he glowered from the ravine.
Suspicion begets suspicions for truth
seekers. Be on time for coffee hour at the ravine.

February snow wears a cold night

Sunlight and anxiolytic flora

unfinished in the whorl.

A week had gone by and there were no wriggling trout at the end of my line; just soaking shoelaces and rags, dripping twigs and brambles, things Tirthan River wanted out of its water.</description></item></channel></rss>
