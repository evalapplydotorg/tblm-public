<h2>Anti-Body Poem – by Yamini Krishnan</h2>
<p><em>Have you ever tried<br>
to slip out of your skin?</em><br>
Not in the way<br>
that means sad girls<br>
and nights of warped mirrors<br>
shoulders shrugging into themselves—<br>
this is not a poem about my body.<br>
Can a poem secede from<br>
the hands that write it?<br>
I am welded to myself,<br>
to my ones and zeros and chipping<br>
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—<br>
of stepping out of flesh<br>
without anything hanging<br>
off me. A poem I read said bodies<br>
were made of stardust and most days<br>
I want to dissolve into nighttime<br>
like ash or dried leaves in a fist—<br>
something without fingers, something<br>
with flight. The boy says he agrees<br>
with this feminism-sheminism<br>
until it goes too far, and I want to<br>
know if he’s ever tried to detach<br>
from his feet. Sometimes I<br>
want to put my breasts in a box,<br>
hips and thighs in the Godrej<br>
cupboard for some hours<br>
of nothingness until I’m ready<br>
for the world to see me as a woman<br>
again. But things do not<br>
disappear when you stop<br>
looking at them and I will<br>
sit contemplating loudness,<br>
hemlines and making my voice<br>
smaller. To exist within flesh<br>
is to be wriggling constantly—<br>
to coat myself in red-brick<br>
dust and other people’s words.<br>
This is not about my body,<br>
but look at its audacity. The way<br>
it paces around the living room,<br>
and how it never picks up its shoes.</p>
