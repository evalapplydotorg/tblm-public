<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Sunlight and anxiolytic flora<br>
drink themselves silly;<br>
an eastern pinch of sky blurts<br>
like it forgot to take its pills.<br>
The worm has wept<br>
all Sunday while you were<br>
reading the newspaper.<br>
Of watering the taste of a fleck<br>
of midnight fruit between your teeth.<br>
Of the hummingbird, disturbed<br>
by the sound of hideous undressing,<br>
again leaving the portrait<br>
of uncut happiness<br>
unfinished in the whorl.<br>
Mist rises toward<br>
the balcony and leaves<br>
a trace on the rails.<br>
V is in the kitchen rinsing<br>
the stained cloth.<br>
Wind bends a shrub,<br>
exposing its mangled roots.<br>
An unsettling wave of sound<br>
rises from the valley:<br>
like it’s time to hear<br>
what has made through;<br>
clouds rushing in like the early<br>
death of someone you never knew.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your Father’s Shirt</strong></p>
<p><em>For A</em></p>
<p>No matter how many times I was told<br>
that the russet stain on it was paint<br>
my mind only saw blood.<br>
First blood, then paint, then disbelief.<br>
I never believed you, my sense of worth<br>
didn’t let me, I fathered my fear until<br>
it turned friendly. My son usurped me.<br>
What you gave up slowly revives, greening<br>
above the surface, but the mind<br>
meanders toward what it first sees.<br>
I failed to see your longing for your father<br>
as a footnote to me. How could any love<br>
that drew from within the same source<br>
as your love for him, its dedication, be untrue?<br>
I was deceived by my destiny of fathers.<br>
In my life’s revolutions of fathers, my answer,<br>
too, was disguised in a father, but the mind<br>
meanders toward what it first sees.<br>
First father, then fear, then flounder.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Montparnasse</strong></p>
<p>On closer inspection there was nothing<br>
that suggested dehydration,<br>
maybe it was merely our differences<br>
of opinion turning you a pale green.<br>
Somebody must love you like this.<br>
I wanted the forlorn and nugatory cookie<br>
of graves, you wanted water.<br>
At the tomb I saw fresh birdshit<br>
and greatly resisted analogous<br>
strokes of joy with his work.<br>
This would be the last cemetary<br>
we were ever going to visit together.<br>
There would be enough time<br>
for literature and birdshit.<br>
But it was you who said<br>
‘Hey, that looks like a fingerprint,<br>
there on the shit.’<br>
And true enough it was.<br>
I wanted to kiss the bird’s cloaca,<br>
then you, then whoever’s hand<br>
that finger belonged to.<br>
You kneeled beside the tap to drink.<br>
Sunlight, the bad actor, crashed through<br>
the maples. My lines to him I forgot,<br>
my lines to you I whispered into the water.<br>
The tomb gave its best, did nothing at all.<br>
Far at the entrance the guard explained<br>
something to an old woman.<br>
She looked like she understood.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Son of</strong></p>
<p>The part of the mind that is<br>
infallible has been unkind<br>
in general to my friends.<br>
I always see them digging<br>
furiously under the shade<br>
of a large tree.<br>
Their parents are, of course, already dead.<br>
And I almost say to myself<br>
“How lucky.” but my mind is drawn<br>
To loose strips of plastic fluttering<br>
on some high branch.<br>
And I say to myself<br>
“dead or alive you’ll be unlucky.”<br>
There is no part of the mind that is<br>
kind or infallible.<br>
Dead friend, friendly dread,<br>
dear sound of furious digging,<br>
day has barely begun and I already<br>
cannot drink anymore.</p>
