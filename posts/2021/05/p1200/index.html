<h2>This Poem is Deliberately Untitled – by Dr. H S Anupama (tr. Kamalakar Bhat)</h2>
<p>If my clothes get torn, I mend them<br>
If soiled, I wash them<br>
If I find no clothes<br>
I will walk nude like you, Akka, but<br>
How do I wash the dirt on a dress not worn?</p>
<p>If my sandal’s straps come undone, I’ll repair them<br>
Left with a single shoe, will put it away<br>
I could even cross the thorny, stony paths barefoot, but<br>
If the path begins to devour the feet, Akka<br>
Where should I place my step?</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>All across the body the unbodied slithers<br>
At the blossoming of breasthairabdomen;<br>
Life flounders,<br>
Anthills sprout all over the body,<br>
Their mouths become vaginas,<br>
Snakes silently slither in and out;<br>
The body of thousand vaginas<br>
Menstruating all the seasons.</p>
<p>War is not waged elsewhere<br>
Violence is not only for extremists<br>
It is not the sound of bullets alone that terrify;<br>
This body<br>
That rots, turns to ash, to dust<br>
With secret terrors of its genitalia,<br>
The warzone where captives combat;<br>
It is a field for violence and suffering,<br>
Because this body<br>
endures, bears, gratifies.</p>
<p>Scared to hum <em>Jack and Jill…</em> with eyes shut,<br>
Scared to utter <em>Jill came tumbling after</em>,<br>
With the skirt held up at the playground<br>
And the tiny tits bouncing<br>
Mom is scared to bits.</p>
<p>It is said, there was a bold one<br>
Who sang forth upright naked and alone,<br>
Not mating, not bearing, she was wedded to god;<br>
And it is said, there was another one<br>
Who became pregnant to Sun by just desire.</p>
<p>O, God<br>
I have no more words…<br>
Give this boon<br>
That the duality ends and<br>
life is no more born of vaginas.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Hunger, sleep, copulation devour the soul;<br>
The river flowing cold in the ravines devours time;<br>
The meandering path devours dreams;<br>
Thus, this village amid the hills<br>
Is faced with an unending evening.</p>
<p>The surrounding dark green hills<br>
Consume all noises,<br>
And stillness spreads<br>
Where no screams,<br>
No slogans,<br>
No celebratory chatter,<br>
Make a sound.</p>
<p>With the tear that rolls down without a sound<br>
A mountainous silence booms, devouring the hills.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, cowardly words, you hide behind<br>
The tears,<br>
The bent head,<br>
The panic-stricken sobs of the little girl,<br>
The sighs from the ICUs;</p>
<p>The cawing of the crows,<br>
The hissing of the snakes,<br>
The squealing of the pigs,<br>
Too have meaning.</p>
<p>If you,<br>
Who can’t turn heartaches into song,<br>
Have any shame,<br>
Plunge into a volcano<br>
And take a rebirth to be born with<br>
Raised voice<br>
Clenched fist<br>
Upright stride.</p>
