<h2>Two Poems – by Ajay Kumar Nair</h2>
<p><strong>touchscream</strong></p>
<p>diwali outside, & names smoke on my tongue<br>
with the taste of burning diyas / in the TV’s</p>
<p>glitching glow the blue chips packet is passed<br>
around, the remote has a coat of masala magic</p>
<p>from our fingers / with a touch, I harvest red<br>
notification blossoms on green whatsapp boughs</p>
<p>watch the single tick split into two, then turn<br>
blue under the dotted shade of typing, online</p>
<p>typing, last seen, typing… click on clickbaits<br>
to be proven right / like a worm in the damp</p>
<p>soil of the internet, hooked onto a promise of<br>
water, however salty, only to come undone in</p>
<p>an algorithm of annuli / scroll thumbnails on<br>
pornsites, looking for something the shape of</p>
<p>us / but not clicking on it, guilted by what I am<br>
looking for / when a rare torrent finds a firm</p>
<p>seed, I feel the world might just get along sharing<br>
touchscreen dreams from broken echochambers</p>
<p>in the 3am heat, a hum through a flame of clapping<br>
hands becomes a hymn / apocalyptically lit blue</p>
<p>packets of petrol pumps dot my dream like masala<br>
magic fireflies alighting on the branches of a dark</p>
<p>country creeping north / I wake up shooting pebbles<br>
across eddying shallows of my mind to roiling blues</p>
<p>of my body & trace its descent into the phosphorous<br>
dark while being kneedeep in it myself / I wake up</p>
<p>under a blue blanket patterned with leaves fleshing<br>
peach at the tips, burned by fireworks of yesterday</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>homecome</strong></p>
<p>by morning, we arrive & the first thing I see<br>
is the hand pipe planted in the front yard with</p>
<p>a hose running all the way to the toilet in the<br>
back fitted with a new western / grandpa gets</p>
<p>up from his armchair & looks at us & sinks back<br>
in the last of his skin holding onto his bones with</p>
<p>fingers around an inhaler / as he breathes into it<br>
the capsules inside swirl like anchovies / it isn’t</p>
<p>as easy as it used to be, he says / we cousins sit in<br>
silence & watch the justcleared sky with a harp of</p>
<p>smoke strung by a singing wingspan / come see me<br>
if you want to see me alive for the last time, he had</p>
<p>said to his children & his children came, taking us<br>
along / I find the last VHS of my parents’ marriage</p>
<p>unspooling quietly in a rotting closet but not<br>
before they salvaged it onto a hard disk / but not</p>
<p>without pink & green glitchstains / dad cuts banana<br>
leaves & aunt serves us fish in it that tastes more of</p>
<p>earth than water / a single strand of steelwool is then<br>
a memory sitting down crosslegged on the winterfed</p>
<p>mosaic floor / a luxury to have made hunger patient<br>
by habit / the children keep forgetting what they came</p>
<p>for / their father on his armchair in the verandah, inhaler<br>
to his lips like the beedis in his youth, talking of spirits</p>
<p>that have stopped coming because they’re afraid of<br>
electric lines / regrets his career in the electricity board</p>
<p>but collects his pension anyway / pointing at spots in the sky<br>
where rainclouds snakecharm peacocks / it thunders like gods</p>
<p>cocked a gun into clouds & went bang / a dog takes cover<br>
under a coconut / my cousin on his phone returns a smile</p>
<p>that sinks somewhere between us before ebbing again<br>
at the first scent of his ringtone / it isn’t as easy as it</p>
<p>used to be / there will be ash on our shuttles as we<br>
homecome / it is purple evening & we have to do</p>
<p>something / we shuffle a deck of cards stitched<br>
together from two incomplete sets / a game of</p>
<p>donkey becomes the saltburdened mule with each<br>
passing round / the smoke of the kerosene lamp</p>
<p>licks my grandma’s portraits in which she was<br>
edited into a sari she never wore with a necklace</p>
<p>she never had / to show we already had what we<br>
have gained / at night a whiff of the mat with its</p>
<p>fraying weave undoing the palmfuls of effort wished<br>
into it / we resort to grandma’s old saris sunk in mothballs</p>
<p>of closeted air / the glitchstained TV is plugged out<br>
to make way for the table fan/ from the stool it scans us</p>
<p>like a god’s judgment encrypted in a theory of winds<br>
as we go to take a piss before we go to sleep / it thunders</p>
<p>but the tired sky only grumbles with ghosts clouded<br>
in wrinkles / the toilet has a rope so that grandpa can get up</p>
<p>by himself / burnt firewood ash meets the ebbing of the water<br>
all the way from the yard pipe / we boys can go in the woods</p>
<p>so we go to rain & come back wet / wait for the others to return<br>
& look at grandma’s portrait with a garland shriveled to rosary</p>
<p>when everyone has returned we go to sleep under old saris<br>
spirited with windy judgments / I dream of a dog with a spine</p>
<p>of sawdust walking through a dam of coconut shells to unbury<br>
a VHS & some pills & a corpse of a fat lizard / by next morning<br>
we depart, waving hands to erase some inevitable unseen shape</p>
