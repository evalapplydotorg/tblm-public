<h2>Three Poems – by Siddharth Dasgupta</h2>
<p><strong>The Drunkard of Pattinson Rd.</strong></p>
<p>On the radio, something from the 1950s.<br>
You know immediately when something’s from<br>
the 1950s—the hesitancy of voice, the ire<br>
of age; the innocence, nothing more than<br>
a photograph wrapped in quatrain, left<br>
to the whims of verses dipped in fire.</p>
<p>In a city, its eyes the roar of minarets,<br>
I try and trace the passage of love. Lafz,<br>
spoken and swallowed by air or left behind<br>
in the moodiness of books. The words, broken,<br>
bitten and chewed and memorised to heart,<br>
these shy fragments of fractal perfection.</p>
<p>Ardour meanders like the waywardness<br>
of the weather—Gauhar Jaan’s soliloquys,<br>
exhumed, dipped in the nasha of aged Shiraz.<br>
Love is this land’s rich lineage, ink and mythos,<br>
blood, an autumnal empire of things being<br>
beautiful, if only to burn, and some day,<br>
in the lap of auroras, be born again.</p>
<p>I follow the trail of love into neighborhoods<br>
where stanzas line the streets—some the<br>
draped playfulness of Urdu, some the crisp<br>
decoration of Hindi, some the sweetened<br>
kiss of Bangla—dancing my way through<br>
rosewater fountains and gardens bisected in<br>
fours, my dreams by now bisected in halves.</p>
<p>A night, its veins ripped apart. A splinter<br>
of Khusrau, splitting the stillness of time.<br>
This land’s umbilical marks, its legacies<br>
opulently reaped; my inquest of love, now<br>
dowsed in the strange fruit of attar, lune,<br>
and the crescent of uninhabited things.</p>
<p>I carry the overture with me, a 1950s<br>
dream, holding a composition of desire<br>
and Ghalib’s wounded lunacies. I shall<br>
continue my search as long as the song<br>
continues to play. The hesitancy of voice;<br>
the ire of age. This heart bound to the<br>
mischief of air. <em>Dil-e-Nadan tujhe hua kya hai…</em></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Should You Ever Leave the Aegean</strong></p>
<p>The seventh day of August is when<br>
the weather turns. I can hear it in<br>
the stillness, that temporary pause<br>
in the love affair, before the final<br>
departure of disco-pink tourists,<br>
and in time, the undressing.</p>
<p>In this foreign air, in the spasms<br>
of this foreign light, I taste Ghalib;<br>
in the screaming hedonism of his<br>
ghazal, in time, his kindred—Hafez.<br>
I rescue three birds of Sufi; soon,<br>
their promiscuous melodies will have<br>
torn hawthorn-shaped enigmas<br>
in the arrogance of the sky.</p>
<p>Laila is in her blue longing. I miss<br>
her already, all sherbet lips and songs<br>
of strange delights. In time, farewells<br>
brewed in the darkened charisma of<br>
unknown languages. The drenched<br>
telegrams of dreams written and<br>
posted, but never to arrive.</p>
<p>I bite into a poem, allow its tangy<br>
melodrama to fill my sclera. Lungful<br>
of an orphaned chrysalis. There will<br>
be a boat at seven, departing from<br>
the placenta of two ruined continents.<br>
All love is crumpled newspapers.<br>
A newspaper-boat, with a man<br>
stranded within it. This song will<br>
fathom the sea. In blue. In time.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desiderata, Times Two</strong></p>
<p>Lie, stir. After a while, our bodies are paintings—<br>
carefully composed limbs, a smidgeon of unexpected<br>
light. I lie on her lap, reading from Sylvia Plath.<br>
She speaks of broken things, of tissue and thirst,<br>
translucence, of days lashed with a silent gnawing,<br>
written into the silences of my lover’s book—its<br>
gathering of underlined lines and forgotten leaves.</p>
<p>I wish we could capture certain afternoons and<br>
store them in casks or drawers. Sure, we have<br>
memory, but it might still be worthwhile to have<br>
something whose <em>uncasking</em> or <em>undrawing</em> sends<br>
reverberations into the vulnerabilities of our skin<br>
—an arousal, in stanzas; the inflection of opera.<br>
The tenor, each measure, an errant surge in serif.</p>
<p>Shadows shift about in restlessness. Cadenza,<br>
ravenous for finale, where even touch feels like<br>
tremor, the torment of taste. Perfumed, her<br>
sighs, with the kissed transference of some more<br>
Sylvia Plath. I move the drapes and breathe<br>
in the sea—the lighthouse to the east, reminding<br>
me of home, of how almost everything lies east.</p>
<p>Impious lips; these afternoons of fermented olives<br>
and whispering candelabra, burn, breathlessly lit.<br>
As a boy, I thought you’d be safe, as long as you<br>
could get yourself to a lighthouse. We are the myths<br>
we swallow, its finely-seasoned inconsistencies.<br>
I lick her language and inhale her hair, hoping<br>
against hope, that I can get myself to a lighthouse.</p>
