<div>Turmeric
My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.</div>

<div>There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?</div>

<div>Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</div>

<div>August Twenty-Twenty
This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and
the receipts of the past. I wish
for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the
blurred edges of time. I am asked
to let go, so instead I sit at the ledge
with a hand dangling outside, collecting rain for warmer days, when perhaps</div>

<div>We wonder what the moth wonders
when she flutters to the lone,
warm bulb that stutters
in the nondescript nook of our house,
possibly looking for faith the way we do.
If she does find it fumbling in trepid waters
that are first bitter and soon engulfing like most
unfamiliar emotions, we may think she is where
we are, at the brink of realizing that we are not</div>

<div>Omphalophobia
“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch</div>

We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us
each morning. Orange, a song
which they will teach us. Mexico
on a thick stalk. In late fall,</div>

<div>How does one speak of love
amnesia is an attic full of salvation,
a tainted spine brewing soft waters into memory.
you speak a language recently forgotten,
of sentences reeking of mason jars and tombstones;
weaving a sister tongue of lost identity
I often wonder if you remember how warm figs taste like, or the scent of sour raisins staining your shoulder,
If it were up to me, I would kiss words into your mouth, breath them with silken tenderness and tuck them behind your teeth so you never have to sing a lullaby of wounded silence.</div>

the ladies of the neighborhood arrive.
Then

like her private garden.
Tending to me
like a page from her Koran,
or like the kantha my foremothers stitched.
Nine minutes of complete attention.
Every stem, every root, every bend.
She bends on me like a lover, a mother, a devotee.
Stretching? she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,
we are collaborators, co-gardeners and florists, all in one.</div>

<div>The Pianist
Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.</div>

The mailman is your friend now. His wife and you both practice yoga. She’s into hot yoga, you’re following the Iyengar school. He, the mailman and you are both happy about this conversation.
Or when you see skeletons of trees and realize that all the branches are a series of multiple “Y”s and you glue a “Y” to every thought that crosses your mind.</div>

<div>Beauty in stillness, evinced by dead flowers
in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,
with slurries, and piss, dour hiking trips to the ravine.
Man on the bridge: You’re not welcome here.
Bring immigration papers—he glowered from the ravine.
Suspicion begets suspicions for truth
seekers. Be on time for coffee hour at the ravine.
The Sufi crunches halves of maple leaf jalebi.</div>

February snow wears a cold night

fellow occupants of fresh obituaries in stale newspapers.

in lost samovars of salted tea served with warm butter
at funerals of young militants to thirsty mourners.
Thirsty mourners
sit across each other in saffron tents

If I find no clothes

How do I wash the dirt on a dress not worn?

Left with a single shoe, will put it away
I could even cross the thorny, stony paths barefoot, but

wall of sand stands against
the sky and stretches. At night it
turns homely: restaurants light
up its alleys. We get drunk on
its shrunken size and our
escape from the guide’s
intoning of its history.
Especially
the slave chambers, ferret
holes in which they were
shoved, stacked and sold –
on which Khiva thrived
for centuries. The cages
aren’t empty but thick

Sunlight and anxiolytic flora
drink themselves silly;
an eastern pinch of sky blurts
like it forgot to take its pills.
The worm has wept
all Sunday while you were
reading the newspaper.
Of watering the taste of a fleck
of midnight fruit between your teeth.
Of the hummingbird, disturbed
by the sound of hideous undressing,
again leaving the portrait
of uncut happiness
unfinished in the whorl.

<div>Have you ever tried
to slip out of your skin?
Not in the way
that means sad girls
and nights of warped mirrors
shoulders shrugging into themselves—
this is not a poem about my body.
Can a poem secede from
the hands that write it?
I am welded to myself,
to my ones and zeros and chipping
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—
of stepping out of flesh
without anything hanging</div>

<div>The tea cup has broken
in the shape of your lip –
the way people break
when nudged by grief.
The ink has spilled near the pocket
in the shape of a territory –
the stain stays –
the way an occupier does.
The paperback has dog eared
around the edges –
the way Time arrives
as a wave.
The mirror has splintered
into fragments –
the way autumnal leaves crunch</div>

<div>Learning Malayalam
Manjadithara, Puthupally, 1982
അ
On the layer of sand
that my forefinger parts, the curvaceous overture
begins to reveal an elephant in a
line drawing.
I taste succulent jungle grass.
Say, if I held the shell
of the first alphabet close to my ear,
would it be
a tribute to the mammal’s memory—
something I need
to embark on a journey of language?

In innocence, I saw only</div>

<div>The Drunkard of Pattinson Rd.
On the radio, something from the 1950s.
You know immediately when something’s from
the 1950s—the hesitancy of voice, the ire
of age; the innocence, nothing more than
a photograph wrapped in quatrain, left
to the whims of verses dipped in fire.
In a city, its eyes the roar of minarets,
I try and trace the passage of love. Lafz,
