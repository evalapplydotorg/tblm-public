Turmeric
My mother is a shade of cinnamon,
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —
white, red — replaces them every five years.
They have traces of gold in them,
and grief. You can see them quiver
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.
Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm
converging at some point in her body
where everything turbulent settles down.

There are more stars, you
used to say, than
all the rice in your aluminium
tub. On my banana leaf,
the stars heap and
watery chutney
milky-ways around them,
around clumps of kadle-manoli asteroids.
A lone happala shines chipped in the corner,
sandige moons orbiting that dwarf planet.
Remember how you used to string
them up and offer them to the Bhutas?
Can these gods see the rings of Saturn?

Saffron
An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father
uses the toilet longer than any man.
Forgetting how these conversations always end,
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.
If they know beef hurts our
sentiments, he asks me, why eat it?
On the screen, a pack of gray wolves
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.
I tell him lynchings are unjust
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.

The colors are vivid. Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature. I couldn’t decline.

This has been the longest not-August,
the unwieldy-est still-March, my windows fogged with tomorrow’s forecast and
the receipts of the past. I wish
for nothing in particular. A return seems unimaginable, but an un-return sends my trembling fingers to the
blurred edges of time. I am asked
to let go, so instead I sit at the ledge
with a hand dangling outside, collecting rain for warmer days, when perhaps

We wonder what the moth wonders
when she flutters to the lone,
warm bulb that stutters
in the nondescript nook of our house,
possibly looking for faith the way we do.
If she does find it fumbling in trepid waters
that are first bitter and soon engulfing like most
unfamiliar emotions, we may think she is where
we are, at the brink of realizing that we are not

I didn’t fear Radhika until I had fallen in love with her. Our first years together were all sex and electric conversation. She was in her goth phase then, her eyes lined with kohl that shone like hot tar, and she wore dark maroon lipstick. “Oxblood,” she said when I asked her what it was called. “Rad… won’t you wear pink once in a while?” She rolled her eyes.
Oh, how I craved her!

The arctic waves lap over me, freezing the blood in my veins. Shame ushers in a memory of shame. The snapping strap of my bathing suit – shame – my incipient breast sliding out – it grips me – the horror and the shame. Shame is a hirsute monster lurking in the depths; slaying it was my salvation.
It can be cold within these walls, painted with tears, vomit, and blood.

Omphalophobia
“Will you be as gods? Gaze in your omphalos”.
– Ulysses, James Joyce
I have a deep and mouse-eyed fear
of my navel. An eyeless socket,
it has something ominous about it.
The tangled scar it cradles
is a disfigured rosebud that yearns
to open into perfection in some
exotic garden. When I have run
a mile or defied gravity, it traps
the transparent elephants
of my sweat in its abysmal ditch

Petaled Geography
We grow plants uncommon in
Pennsylvania. Like cotton.
Cotton bolls, our own bit of Georgia.
Did they miss red soil? And plumeria,
Hawaii in a container. Salmon-colored
blossoms. We’ve never been to Hawaii
so we brought it here. Red adeniums,
Madagascar beside our shed.
Tall Mexican sunflowers call to us
each morning. Orange, a song
which they will teach us. Mexico

How does one speak of love
amnesia is an attic full of salvation,
a tainted spine brewing soft waters into memory.
you speak a language recently forgotten,
of sentences reeking of mason jars and tombstones;
weaving a sister tongue of lost identity
I often wonder if you remember how warm figs taste like, or the scent of sour raisins staining your shoulder,
If it were up to me, I would kiss words into your mouth, breath them with silken tenderness and tuck them behind your teeth so you never have to sing a lullaby of wounded silence.

She plucked and weeded me
like her private garden.
Tending to me
like a page from her Koran,
or like the kantha my foremothers stitched.
Nine minutes of complete attention.
Every stem, every root, every bend.
She bends on me like a lover, a mother, a devotee.
Stretching? she says, and plumes me like a bouquet.
I stretch, she slices, stretch and slice, stretch and slice,
we are collaborators, co-gardeners and florists, all in one.

The Pianist
Pruning my words as tranquil targets,
three girls aged ten trebled my response
to our music instructor’s initial inquiry:
“the flute felt like floating on a cloud.”
Flight dispersed further away with each word
uttered so I tucked infatuation to soar safely
alongside daymares kept under lock and key,
threaded through the bodies battered by a butterfly
shaped hole-puncher. I bit my lip so often, skin
perpetually hung as an apology for my existence.

How to know that you’re new to New York
The mailman is your friend now. His wife and you both practice yoga. She’s into hot yoga, you’re following the Iyengar school. He, the mailman and you are both happy about this conversation.
Or when you see skeletons of trees and realize that all the branches are a series of multiple “Y”s and you glue a “Y” to every thought that crosses your mind.

Beauty in stillness, evinced by dead flowers
in milkjugs. I found untold power hidden at the ravine.
November in Toronto is a shameful grey,
with slurries, and piss, dour hiking trips to the ravine.
Man on the bridge: You’re not welcome here.
Bring immigration papers—he glowered from the ravine.
Suspicion begets suspicions for truth
seekers. Be on time for coffee hour at the ravine.
The Sufi crunches halves of maple leaf jalebi.

February snow wears a cold night

fellow occupants of fresh obituaries in stale newspapers.

at funerals of young militants to thirsty mourners.
Thirsty mourners

If my clothes get torn, I mend them
If soiled, I wash them
If I find no clothes
I will walk nude like you, Akka, but
How do I wash the dirt on a dress not worn?
If my sandal’s straps come undone, I’ll repair them
Left with a single shoe, will put it away
I could even cross the thorny, stony paths barefoot, but
If the path begins to devour the feet, Akka

Especially
the slave chambers, ferret
holes in which they were
shoved, stacked and sold –
on which Khiva thrived
for centuries. The cages

Sunday
Sunlight and anxiolytic flora
drink themselves silly;
an eastern pinch of sky blurts
like it forgot to take its pills.
The worm has wept
all Sunday while you were
reading the newspaper.
Of watering the taste of a fleck
of midnight fruit between your teeth.
Of the hummingbird, disturbed
by the sound of hideous undressing,
again leaving the portrait
of uncut happiness
unfinished in the whorl.

Have you ever tried
to slip out of your skin?
Not in the way
that means sad girls
and nights of warped mirrors
shoulders shrugging into themselves—
this is not a poem about my body.
Can a poem secede from
the hands that write it?
I am welded to myself,
to my ones and zeros and chipping
nails and I dream of being elsewhere—
of stepping out of flesh
without anything hanging

Puro was a young jat girl who danced the giddha and who, while playing on the swing, always soared higher than anyone else.

You know immediately when something’s from

of age; the innocence, nothing more than
a photograph wrapped in quatrain, left
to the whims of verses dipped in fire.
In a city, its eyes the roar of minarets,
I try and trace the passage of love. Lafz,
spoken and swallowed by air or left behind

Back then Papa and I would hop across rocks and boulders along the Tirthan River every morning, with our fishing rods in hand—he had a sleek fly rod and I had an amateur’s spinner. He had just started me on fishing, and we did our lessons before I walked with Madhu to school.
A week had gone by and there were no wriggling trout at the end of my line; just soaking shoelaces and rags, dripping twigs and brambles, things Tirthan River wanted out of its water.
