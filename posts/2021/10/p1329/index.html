<p>The colors are vivid. Red and black dominate. Fire and smoke. Guns and roses. The meadows, mountains, streams, that make their home ‘heaven on earth’ as the Mughal emperor once exulted, are replaced by stones and blood. I’m not surprised by the themes but I was surprised when they asked me to judge the contest. My first instinct was to refuse. But they sent me an invite with Muqeet’s signature. I couldn’t decline.</p>
<p>The school wants me to pick a winner, but going through these drawings takes reserves of energy that I struggle to find. Even these simple photos my grandson has sent this morning, his graduation pictures with his parents, have exhausted me. I ask him, with difficulty, for a graduation present—that’s what they call it in the United States where he studies—and he says he wants my Banaras painting for his condo. In the next call, I hope to sound clearer. I’ve been taking speech therapy sessions from a lady named Geetika. She visits my house on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and for the past six weeks we have been doing various exercises. Soon, I hope, she will help me speak more than monosyllables.</p>
<p>Geetika asks me to suck a thick liquid with a straw, then rinse the mouth with water as she puts her hand over my shoulder which doesn’t help me in anyway but I do notice Kashida embroidery on her kurta. White on white, a clear detour from the regular Kashida work which is very colorful. She gently places a vibrator around my lips for about a minute and then asks me to fill a rubber balloon. I struggle for a while. As she starts talking about the connection between these exercises and the facial muscles, I see my painting of a garage mechanic in the background. Shades of yellow and orange merging in the center, surrounded by green and indigo blotches inside a mute golden frame.</p>
<p>Geetika looks at me, You look rather tired?</p>
<p>Yes, I mumble. Suddenly the word pulls me deeper in my chair. I hand her a thousand rupees, and she leaves without meeting Supriya, my wife, who must be leafing through magazines in the next room.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I have a doctorate in English Literature from Patna University, where I taught the subject for more than twenty years. My love affair with painting began when I was a doctorate student. A calling, I tell my wife, when she expresses her disapproval. She didn’t consider me a painter until the Government of Mauritius invited me to help them set up the Department of Arts and Crafts at the Rabindranath Tagore Institute. She takes me for a walk at six p.m. every day, a stick in hand and cloves in pocket. We take three circular rounds around our house and wait for our cook to prepare dinner. Rice, lentils, spiced potatoes with spinach or okra or green peppers. I have used less oil and spices, she says in Hindi, eat on time.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>It is Tuesday. I wait for Geetika with anticipation. The rest of the day is usual, uninspiring. The winner has been chosen. A boy pelting stones and dozens of guns around him exhaling fireballs. I imagine the winner, a thirteen-year-old boy solving algebra problems in a middle school. The tickets are booked for our Srinagar trip. Geetika promises to bring a mango ice-cream for our last class, with Supriya’s permission, of course. My facial movements have become symmetric in a way. Speaking, swallowing, suction and facial expressiveness have become easier, if not as effortless as the pre-paralysis time. The maid, announces Geetika’s arrival when the doorbell rings. She invites her in, and calls Supriya from the kitchen.</p>
<p>She carries a plastic bag which has ice cream cups and wooden spoons. It looks out of place in the company of the plush leather bag she is carrying, and even more so when she places it next to the wooden fruit baskets on the dining table, in this house bereft of any asymmetry.</p>
<p>We sit next to each other at the dining table, and I tell her I want to speak complex sentences. She seems pleased that I am taking initiative. Let’s try, she says. She picks up a coffee table book of Marcel Duchamp’s paintings and quotes. She opens a random page before sliding the book to me. Try to speak slowly, she says. Don’t get stuck on any one part. Keep reading without any pause.</p>
<p>Marcel Duchamp: <em>In the beginning, the cubists broke up form without even knowing they were doing it. Probably the compulsion to show multiple sides of an object forced us to break the object up – or, even better, to project a panorama that unfolded different facets of the same object.</em></p>
<p>We move our chairs so we are facing each other, and she looks at me with a mixture of encouragement and acceptance. She is offering herself up to patience undimmed by outside noise of neighborhood children. I start off well but feel some stiffness by the time I reach the last few words. I pause, and she asks me to continue when I am ready.</p>
<p>You’ve made me a parrot, she laughs, and touches the ice-cream cups. They’re sugar free, she says handing me a cup and a spoon. Do the exercises every day, three times a day – morning, afternoon and night.</p>
<p>I want her to continue visiting me, but it’s something I want to decide after my trip. I will not give commitment now and then go back on it. I am afraid of the feelings it might evoke. We end early because I am tired. She looks over the paintings in the dining room, and says, Your paintings remind me of Eugene Delacroix.</p>
<p>Geetika types the name into her phone and shows me paintings by Eugene Delacroix, a French painter. Our heads almost touching, we look at the paintings together. She lets me tap on her phone to view different paintings.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Geetika asks to be paid. I bring out my cheque book and ask for her full name.</p>
<p>Geetika Zargar.</p>
<p>She nods.</p>
<p>Geetika Zargar is a unique name, I say.</p>
<p>She shrugs, then smiles. I was born in Lucknow only. Fell in love with a Kashmiri boy in my college and got married. Returned five years back. She doesn’t elaborate, and something in her demeanour stiffens. For a moment I catch a glimpse of another Geetika: a woman who has tried, and failed at rebellion.</p>
<p>I ask whether she has any children.</p>
<p>One daughter, she says. Nine year old.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I’m thinking about the trip, and how I’d get to see my college friends. The organizer, an old acquaintance, calls, and I don’t answer the phone because the return date is yet to be fixed. My phone prods me with a text message: What is the return date again? Booking a hotel for the weekend. Can extend stay. See you soon.</p>
<p>I met Supriya in our college during the last year, in a farewell party hosted by a mutual friend who was intent on setting us up for reasons as yet unknown to me. The friend later claimed she had an intuition that Supriya and I would click instantly.</p>
<p>What does that mean? I once asked, assuming some astrological theory.</p>
<p>Just, you know, Libra and Gemini, both air signs, great communication and all, I could tell you would make a good match, she said.</p>
<p>Supriya was training to be a biologist, and I was a graduate student hoarding notebooks filled with bad screenplays. She danced, and I didn’t like any classical dances. My table manners made her cringe and I didn’t understand her humor, which involved riddles and science-related jokes. What do you call the leader of a biology gang? The nucleus. How do scientists freshen their breath? With experi-mints! The person I was back then, a stranger to myself now, agreed to a date, and then three more, before our parents got us married. What got to me was her free spirit. The world was so much more beautiful by her side. She was always pointing out things: a pear-shaped tree, a new sunset point, an antique furniture shop, the beauty of mountains and lakes I walked past every day. After a year of marriage I realized Supriya’s outward-looking nature was also another side of her flighty nature: she was mesmerized by new things. Her interest in me waxed and waned over the years but I remained in her radar.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>It was six in the evening when Supriya entered my studio. If I decline her call for an evening walk, she’ll say that I am eating two mangoes a day and my diabetes is on the borderline. I know this to be untrue because I read the test reports and they were normal, but I know she is concerned because my parents were diabetic and died of heart attack and she suspects I’ll follow their route.</p>
<p>I play out the fight with her in my head if I continue painting, realize it would end with me losing my focus. I don’t ask the question. Instead, I find myself being nicer to Supriya on our stroll – placing my hand on her back when we cross the road, which she doesn’t acknowledge. Love, in our case, is indeed a moving river between the shores of our souls, sometimes on my side, sometimes on hers.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>As a child, I often walked by the Jhelum river with my mother. I remember her warm hands, her gold emerald bangles, and the reflection of the sunset on the clear water of the river. I was an unruly child, but the mere mention of a Jinn would straighten me up. I would strictly avoid nightly visits to orchards unless I was with someone. My neighbors, Muiz and Muqeet, often took me to apple orchards behind their house. We hopped from tree to tree and took bites from dozens of juicy apples and managed to run away before the owner, Ramlal, came out dragging his polio-stricken leg. Ramlal often dropped in to my home and complained about me to my parents, and I was scolded and made to apologize. He asked me a series of yes or no questions, to which I kept saying no, and then he told me to stop playing with Muiz and Muqeet which I never agreed to.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>When my brother calls at our usual time, I break news to him that I’m visiting Srinagar and meeting old friends.</p>
<p>What’s the point in reviving those memories, he says.</p>
<p>I change the topic, and ask about his granddaughter, who attends a graduate school in the States and recently married her classmate. He usually speaks of Amayra with a competitive edge to his tone, but today he sounds worried. They are separating, he says. We’ve asked them to see a counsellor. But I don’t see things changing.</p>
<p>It might be nice to have her back, I say.</p>
<p>Five months of marriage, he sighs.</p>
<p>At least you have a son and a granddaughter in the same city. I had a strange dream the other night. I was on a bed and having a video call with my son. He was crying, and wanted directions to my house. I couldn’t give him directions because I was in pain. I kept gazing at his face, but it made him cry more. It was very distressing.</p>
<p>Are you still considering to stay put in Lucknow?</p>
<p>No, I don’t know. Supriya wants to stay back. Her siblings. I don’t think she’d agree. Please don’t send us tickets to visit again. I can’t do long travels. And I don’t want to argue about this again.</p>
<p>Aditya doesn’t push the matter. We are both too tired for our usual fights. He tells me about the new diet his wife has imposed on him. It’s based on Ayurveda, and she gives him bitter gourd juice twice a day along with some herbal pills. Damn annoying. I think she wants me to outlive her which is something she has told me many times. We can’t control our bladder at eighty-two but we want to control the lifespan. I have to go now, he says. I’m meeting some friends.</p>
<p>I have always been envious of my brother’s marriage, and never understood why my parents agreed to an interfaith marriage, while I was asked to refrain from it. It’s destiny, my mother had said, when I asked.<br>
What destiny?</p>
<p>I don’t know. A divine plan. Ask your father.</p>
<p>I don’t believe in all that. It was practical, my father said. They both knew each other from Srinagar days and were in the same city in a foreign country.</p>
<p>This partiality made me furious but I was already married. Besides, I had no Muslim girl on my mind whom I could have married. Even for practicality sake. So I let go of my anger.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>On Thursday, Geetika arrives on my request, and asks about my trip before we begin the lesson. It is thirty-eight degrees and cloudless outside, but before I can respond, she says: Srinagar is magical in spring. Postcard perfect, actually. My husband had a travel agency. Our houseboats were almost booked by this time, provided there were no major clashes. I hope you enjoyed your time. I miss that place every day.</p>
<p>My throat closes up, and I feel hurt. For a moment my thoughts drift, and I place my hands on the armrest and ask her if it’s too warm. Should I turn up the air conditioner? I say.</p>
<p>No, are you? she asks, with unexpected tenderness.</p>
<p>It felt different, I say, imitating her tone. I visited after three decades. You can imagine. Why did you come back to Lucknow?</p>
<p>She tells me about her husband, and how he disappeared one day. She went from one police station to another. Went to army headquarters. Hired a detective but couldn’t figure out a thing. She waited for a year and half in Srinagar and then moved back. It was hard not getting any kind of closure.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in a different Kashmir, I say, surprised by the coldness in my voice. It was a different world. I was more excited about Eid than I was about Diwali. But things changed overnight. Death threats and brutal killings. We couldn’t return. This was the first time I went back in three decades.</p>
<p>Geetika doesn’t say anything for a while, but flips a coffee table book on the table, and asks me to read from the Duchamp book to assess my progress. Don’t push yourself too much, she says. Read out as effortlessly as you can.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Marcel Duchamp: <em>Rational intelligence is dangerous and leads to ratiocination. The painter is a medium who doesn’t realize what he is doing. No translation can express the mystery of sensibility, a word, still unreliable, which is nevertheless the basis of painting or poetry, like a kind of alchemy.</em></p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>At dinner, Supriya asks about my session, but I don’t mention what Geetika and I discussed. She tells me about our grandson who demands a different painting every other day because he keeps changing his mind about the decor. One day he wants my countryside painting, then the next day, after discussion with friends, he wants the boatman painting. This time he has made up his mind, Supriya says.</p>
<p>That’s fine, I say. Tomorrow I was thinking of calling the courier guy. He told me he wants the painting by the end of the month. I hold the painting in front of her.</p>
<p>My wife’s watching a re-run of Mahabharat. Very good, she taps the painting, with the confidence of a mechanic examining a car.</p>
<p>Supriya is absorbed in the saga again. I have no intention of watching it one more time. It was Aditya’s tenth grade when the show was broadcasted for the first time, the year we lived in a refugee camp in Jammu, still hoping we would be able to go back to our home.</p>
<p>The refugee camp appears in my dreams but I haven’t told anyone about it. Trucks with rice and vegetables. Durries that smelt of rat urine. Queues outside the public toilets. Supriya kept in touch with her friends: Sheela, Anuradha and Mala. Sheela is in Delhi, Anuradha in Jaipur and Mala has changed home every five years, so I’ve no idea where she is now.</p>
<p>Supriya likes to talk to them on festivals. She is an active member of the Pandit community in Lucknow and joins them for functions. But I am not interested. She knows the reason. The serial ends and Supriya arrives in the bedroom. She changes into her baby pink night gown and sits next to me. I remove my bifocal glasses and put away the book. I put my hand over her shoulder as she leans over me. She says I am speaking fine and asks if it’s time for Geetika to stop coming. I say, Yes.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>I write a note to Geetika. I spend an hour trying to get the wording right. Am I unable to continue the sessions, or am I simply no longer in need of them? In the end I write that I am terminating the lessons because I would like to invest more time in other parts of my life and it has nothing to do with her Kashmir connection. If anything it distressed me to hear about her husband as much as it did to meet the drawing contest winner who was a pallet gun victim. Do I send her my warmest wishes, or my sincerest regards? I send the maid to Geetika’s house to deliver the note, along with some money. After she leaves, I berate myself for writing about Kashmir. I am unsure whether it would come across as an act of empathy, or a lie.</p>
<p>I start painting the mountains, but my mind wanders, and I go to the drawing room where Supriya is watching a famous chat show. A rapid fire round follows. If you were a private investigator who is that one person you would go after? A piece of advice you wish you would have got ten years ago? An idea that changed your life?</p>
<p>The maid returns with the money. Geetika ma’am said no need, the maid tells me, in Hindi. She hands me the money, along with a book <em>Either/Or: A Fragment of Life</em> by Soren Kierkegaard. I pore over the book, searching for a note, but there is no sign of a message from her.</p>
<p>When my brother calls in the evening, I do not mention any of this. I debated whether to share anything from my trip. It’s not that Aditya harbors any negative feelings. On the contrary, he feels nothing. I can already predict his reaction.</p>
<p>Nostalgia is useless, he will say, with unrestrained snobbery.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>The days move slowly with nothing to look forward to. I resume work on unfinished paintings, but can’t work for long hours. I usually work for two hours in the mornings. I finish reading Geetika’s book, and call her one evening, to thank her for the book.</p>
<p>No need to thank me, she says in a neutral tone.</p>
<p>Can we meet next week?</p>
<p>Why not, she says.</p>
<p>It’s July, and the rain clouds have arrived. I ask if she wants me to make a portrait of her.</p>
<p>Sure, she says.</p>
<p>She sits in my studio, motionless for an hour. After coffee, I ask if she would like to take a stroll.</p>
<p>Yes, she says. We step outside. I want to tell her about an NGO helping half-widows in Srinagar. It starts to drizzle.</p>
<p>I close my eyes, and let the rain drops wet my face. Kierkegaard says all the plans I form fly straight back at me, when I want to spit in my own face.</p>
