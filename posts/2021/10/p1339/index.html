<p><strong>Turmeric</strong></p>
<p>My mother is a shade of cinnamon,<br>
probably less brittle. She wears bangles —<br>
white, red — replaces them every five years.<br>
They have traces of gold in them,</p>
<p>and grief. You can see them quiver<br>
when she kneads, her wrists are hollow flutes<br>
albeit clogged by dough and domesticity.</p>
<p>Veins, like inlets, coursing through her arm<br>
converging at some point in her body<br>
where everything turbulent settles down.</p>
<p>My mother is a pinch of turmeric,<br>
probably less customary. She wears sarees —<br>
red, white — buys one every year.<br>
They are woven from yarns of silk,</p>
<p>and silence. You can hear the village<br>
in her voice when she speaks.<br>
Some days, she’s a lullaby<br>
forgotten midway, some nights<br>
she’s a drop of water rousing a pot of oil.</p>
<p>Last week, while cleaning the rasoi<br>
she threw a fit because someone<br>
had changed the canisters, as if<br>
something within her had been pried open —<br>
exposed, unwrapped</p>
<p>then went on to explain<br>
how light can diminish shelf life,<br>
how spices without a tight lid can<br>
bother people with their presence.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Epidermis</strong></p>
<p>At the grocery store, we are<br>
crossing off items on our to-buy list.<br>
In the organic section, my father<br>
has now begun his quest for onions.</p>
<p>He takes one at a time, rotates it<br>
in his hand to check for dents or deformities</p>
<p>I throw a couple in the basket<br>
to expedite the process but<br>
he quickly tosses them back in<br>
the crate, says <em>this</em> one has a soft<br>
shell and <em>that</em> one has severed roots.</p>
<p>It is both meticulous and somewhat mystical,<br>
how he prods his thumb on their bodies<br>
and just knows which ones will last the week.</p>
<p>At the billing counter, my father stands<br>
somewhat content with his shopping cart.<br>
Before us, is a lady with her little boy who<br>
peeps over her shoulder. I smile at him and<br>
he instantly buries his head in her shoulder.</p>
<p>As she puts her basket on the counter<br>
my old man scoffs,<br>
<em>won’t even last a week</em><br>
tells me the bell peppers<br>
are already soft and wrinkled, the onions,<br>
discoloured; hence, the thumb rule —<br>
<em>always check for soft spots</em>.</p>
<p>The attendant bags the groceries,<br>
my father hands his debit card,<br>
and punches in his secret pin<br>
his quivering hands, calloused and creased,<br>
skin, hardened in a way that can never be peeled.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Yarn</strong></p>
<p><em>A thread cannot be broken,<br>
only torn</em>. You interrupt, in an attempt<br>
to correct me, then underline the improbability<br>
of certain verbs when translated<br>
into a different language. For instance,<br>
as a kid you would break a roti or tear a plate.</p>
<p>Likewise, breaking a thread would be like<br>
tearing a dream, figurative and farfetched,<br>
only possible in poems. The act of breaking<br>
something requires muscle or misfortune,<br>
enough to render it redundant.</p>
<p>Tearing on the other hand, is about strain<br>
or stress, a scintilla adequate to rip you in shreds.</p>
<p>Across the table, a couple<br>
is commemorating, a milestone perhaps.<br>
The waiter, so aptly called, waits<br>
knowing exactly what wine he’ll order,<br>
how much they’ll eat,<br>
how much they’ll <em>post</em>,<br>
and later reminisce about an entrée<br>
they have discontinued, as if it were<br>
the origin of their affiliation.</p>
<p>So intriguing it is to witness<br>
such a ritualistic disentanglement of sorts;<br>
strands of hair, suits, sweaters,<br>
fibres —<br>
neither breaking,<br>
nor tearing,<br>
only coming apart at the seams.</p>
