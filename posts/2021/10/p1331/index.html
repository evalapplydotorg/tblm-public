<p><strong>First Person</strong></p>
<p>I’m sure I initially saw you, the mandrill,<br>
in a children’s illustrated photographic book or<br>
possibly in a <em>National Geographic</em> pictorial and<br>
I always think the same thing about your cream teeth and<br>
Union Jack black red and blue mask<br>
I always think the same thing<br>
you are beautiful you are terrifying</p>
<p>I think, all hail the surreal primate troll<br>
I think, the mammal clown with garish smeared soft<br>
greasepaint crayons marking up your mask and<br>
and I always think the same thing<br>
in passing grades of As, Bs, 70%, firsts<br>
you stalk the textbooks<br>
of anthropology students and teachers and<br>
and I always think the same thing<br>
we the students and I try to think about<br>
misogynist priority of access theories and<br>
and I always think the same thing<br>
you are beautiful like Halloween is beautiful and<br>
and you are terrifying like Halloween is terrifying and<br>
and it’s not October yet and<br>
and it’s the middle of a pandemic and<br>
and it’s what James Baldwin says when<br>
I think about you says more about me</p>
<p>I don’t mean to call myself beautiful but<br>
but perhaps I’m terrifying to others<br>
marked up by lipstick and<br>
and it’s what James Baldwin says when<br>
when I think about you says more about me<br>
alright then you are gorgeous you are beloved<br>
you are witty you are friendly you will live to old age with<br>
with the love of your life have happy grandchildren and<br>
and a German shepherd mix<br>
have the love of your family and<br>
and your friends and the admiration and<br>
and lust of those you desire<br>
you are safe you are healthy you will achieve every<br>
every dream you aspire to achieve you<br>
you will rip off your<br>
my mask<br>
behind it I<br>
you will see<br>
see your<br>
my blue nose your<br>
my red nostrils your<br>
my stripes</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Train from Brighton, Several Years Before We Broke Up</strong></p>
<p>A lake superior of bluebells.<br>
The train stopped to let us have a gander.<br>
The purplebells, bluebells had usurped<br>
the traditional green and brown of<br>
forest ground, flooded over the dull<br>
olives and muds, rubber country boots and jackets<br>
woodstuff alchemy to purple and blue<br>
purple and blue<br>
– purple and blue, to me and you –<br>
through the window glass we heard it when<br>
the birds chittered<br>
the train knit-purled to shaky rolls once more<br>
and in a minute we passed into a view of a parking lot,<br>
with no shopping centre to qualify it.<br>
Car upon car upon purple<br>
metal upon blue metal upon red<br>
metal upon silver metal upon yellow<br>
metal inexplicable yet scarab-lovely in its own way<br>
to my newly bluebelled eyes, and<br>
perhaps for you the same,<br>
till the planes flew by and I knew it<br>
for the airport lot it was.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I’m Definitely Missing the Links Here</strong></p>
<p><em>Proconsul</em> is hypothesised to be<br>
a candidate for the last common<br>
ancestor a deferential potential<br>
abdication to <em>Nyanzipithecus alesi</em><br>
supplanting notwithstanding.<br>
She arrives in theoretical yesterday through<br>
necromancy in our jungle paradise<br>
el dorado mamilla as a given<br>
to ruminate and birth control<br>
all six living apes, her whole shebang:<br>
humans, chimpanzees, bonobos,<br>
gorillas, orangutans, gibbons.</p>
<p>We usually only see <em>Proconsul</em><br>
rock-and-roll in the fake<br>
but familiar scala naturae. Debatably good intentions<br>
auxiliar for the story but, as just one defect,<br>
the scale incorrectly shows the state<br>
of primate evolutions as a sole<br>
progression towards adult European<br>
human males as ultimate solutions.</p>
<p>Through an arrow-linear and narrow scale<br>
from the Miocene to the present,<br>
such a directed model of the in-between<br>
is simple and seductive but reductively<br>
stopbottles all other humans and other<br>
animals who are themselves<br>
accrescent from its tiers.<br>
Like all the apes – including us –<br>
<em>Proconsul</em> had no tale.</p>
