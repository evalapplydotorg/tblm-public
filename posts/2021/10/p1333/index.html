<h2>Three poems – by Karan Kapoor</h2>
<p><strong>Saffron</strong></p>
<p>An avid reader of the Punjab Kesari, my father<br>
uses the toilet longer than any man.</p>
<p>Forgetting how these conversations always end,<br>
I express my repugnance over a mob lynching.</p>
<p><em>If they know beef hurts our<br>
sentiments</em>, he asks me, <em>why eat it?</em></p>
<p>On the screen, a pack of gray wolves<br>
hungry for days, hound a reindeer.</p>
<p>I tell him lynchings are unjust<br>
even if someone eats a cow solely to offend.</p>
<p>How can you ever compare human life<br>
with a cow’s?</p>
<p>The music in the room rises to a crescendo<br>
falls to the sound of teeth against neck.</p>
<p>Deer in the jaw of a wolf — the pack slows,<br>
the death of their hunger close.</p>
<p><em>A hundred and one Muslims can be sacrificed<br>
for a single hair of a cow.</em></p>
<p>The Nat Geo narrator calls it the circle of life.<br>
My father calls it survival.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Helpless Ode</strong></p>
<p>My father asks me to write<br>
a perfect poem, one with no moon.<br>
All moon-poems are clichés,<br>
he says, plus it makes me think<br>
of Muslims and you know how<br>
I feel about them. So if there is<br>
even half a moon in your poem,<br>
I’ll drink tonight. I chip the moon<br>
from my perfect poem and look<br>
for other things. I try to add<br>
oranges, honeybees, a fire licking<br>
a lake of knives, a woman who<br>
is smoke if you look closely, a pig<br>
which is not really a pig but a man<br>
with a dead dog in his arms,<br>
a laughing light, a pink clock<br>
with Shaolin swords as its arms,<br>
Sisyphus’ boulder rolling down,<br>
winged apples, walking pens,<br>
a yawning book — I stash<br>
these images in the refrigerator,<br>
and when my father asks me<br>
to serve him a perfect poem, I offer<br>
him a Black Dog. He’s so dazzled<br>
that instead of saying your poem<br>
couldn’t have been more perfect,<br>
if there is a thing such as that,<br>
he forgets his promise and swigs<br>
the whisky neat, wipes his lips<br>
into a grin. I cry green<br>
tears and dream of carrying<br>
a crescent moon on my head<br>
for the rest of the night.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Nine Reasons to Write a Ghazal in a Time of Fascism</strong></p>
<p>Draw on tongues of two worlds to light a ghazal.<br>
Hijack the fire of the sun, sing the night a ghazal.</p>
<p>You are a passenger of grief, your Stygian<br>
soul one noun alone ignites: a <em>ghazal</em>.</p>
<p>Some break a mosque, some build a temple.<br>
Some bite the bullet, I bite a ghazal.</p>
<p>Blackbird, parrot, nightingale, all need to sing.<br>
When we can compose, why fight a ghazal?</p>
<p>The world brims with bruises and paper.<br>
Curves of words spark respite—a ghazal!</p>
<p>Words elude us in weighted times.<br>
Give in to the want of calm, flight a ghazal.</p>
<p>They’ve changed names of cities, now erasing Nehru;<br>
write, write before they come to set alight a ghazal.</p>
<p>It is a body suited to joy and light. I want to pen—<br>
though, father, you look at me with spite—a ghazal.</p>
<p><em>Karan, are you ashamed of being a Hindu?<br>
If not, then why should you write a ghazal?</em></p>
