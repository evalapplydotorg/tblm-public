<h2>The Sanskari Bahu – by Ravneet Bawa</h2>
<p>is first of all not a person with any<br>
edges. She has a strong middle but her<br>
boundaries are mostly fluid. She must<br>
accommodate. At first, she is expected only<br>
to be pretty. A grandmother-in-law<br>
remarks you must rouge your cheeks when<br>
the ladies of the neighborhood arrive.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>and then she must begin to give. Give of her<br>
sleep a few carefree winks, give of her bath<br>
a few thoughtful scrubs, give of her tea a few<br>
shaved sips till water is rich. Give of her gaze</p>
<p>upon self as she begins to look and look and<br>
never find the girl she was. Give of her will to<br>
disagree as she is asked, always with politeness<br>
<em>to consider</em>. Give also of choices and opinions<br>
since there is such a thing as too much choice<br>
and too many opinions. –Give of her flesh a little<br>
to a lot and a lot to a little– Give she must of her<br>
time, ah endless time endlessly for must she not<br>
be a fount so blessed or cursed it is hard to tell.<br>
Give she must of her time, her time for stupor<br>
and daydreams, her time for books and politics,<br>
for sport and culture, for trivia and serendipity.<br>
Give she must, vacant rooms inside of her.<br>
Give away darkness and intrigue. Give also<br>
her stormy womb a moral compass. <em>Adultery<br>
needs time she doesn’t have.</em> And if she<br>
isn’t spent yet, the Sanskari Bahu<br>
must give away slices of pulpy<br>
mangoes to everyone on<br>
the table as she sits with all the<br>
pits in. her. plate. Pits have a<br>
strong middle and edges<br>
<em>that yield.</em></p>
