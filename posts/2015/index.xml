He has published four novels, namely The Vicks Mango Tree, Tales From A Vending Machine, Vanity Bagh, and The Blind Lady’s Descendants. Of these, Vanity Bagh won the The Hindu Literary Prize in 2013 and The Blind Lady’s Descendants won the Crossword Book Award for English Fiction 2014.
Salim’s narrators retain a straight-faced sense of humour in the face of great personal tragedy and sometimes perform the function of social commentary, the latter never out of any sense of solutionism or false idealism.</description></item><item><title>Boundaries</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/07/p340/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2015 06:28:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/07/p340/</guid><description>summer garbage below
stench rises like yeast
to this fourth floor trap
I strip, circle a dot on a map
a different heat rises
the Tao says
enjoy your food, your family
your garden, your neighbor –
I hear roosters crow
in another country
I am bound to you, I said
I am bound to you, you said
cords of haste waste tangles
underlying current flowing blithe –
forgotten

**
After the mosque and the church, some chestnuts,
after the rain— every drop a passport
to misery— we return to a room not housekept.
As we wait, we’re offered Turkish tea and Apple tea.
The family next to us is, we learn, from Germany.
Well, they’re Iraqis from Germany. We’re Indians
from America. But this evening, we’re all in the lobby
of a hotel in Sultanahmet: united against</description></item><item><title>Srinath Perur</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/05/p299/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 May 2015 13:57:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/05/p299/</guid><description>We at TBLM have long felt the lack of a certain kind of conversation in the Indian literary discourse. There are interviews, yes, but these tend to be promotional in nature, and a writer generally makes appearances around a book launch. That is perhaps a necessity. But the writer interview, one that focuses on the process behind a book, its connection with the writer’s personality, her or his life before and after publication, her or his views about money, rewards and recognition in literary pursuits — is neither present nor being asked for.</description></item><item><title>An Email on Sunday</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p293/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 02:04:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p293/</guid><description>**An Email on Sunday
**
Some emails
are more difficult
to receive
from a child
long out of college
the daughter who writes
her cancer is back
but the doctor says
with chemo and surgery
things should be fine
and all the while
the father wonders
why she didn’t call
at midnight and let
the telephone scream
hysterically in the night
to deliver the news
a computer is too
cold a messenger</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Apr 2015 02:02:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/04/p291/</guid><description>Varanasi, December 2014
You unwelcomed me with fog
on a blinding night
hurrying into history
like the feet of your ghaats
As I crawl up
the rickety slope
of your refrigerated afternoon
I am spiral and backward
in time’s forsaken bedroom
where chaste Hindi adulterates
several slips of tongues
and the languid orality of people
mulls over suicidal lungs
You rise at sundown
by the Ganges
You bathe, you shiver</description></item><item><title>Poema</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p271/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:48:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p271/</guid><description>**I (or The End Of Life)
**
You talk sad.
I talk expensive.
Potato tart appetisers
are rare. Baby shrimp are rare.
But you dog!
It is true.
I am hungry.
Goodbye my waiter!
It is closing time.
**II (or It Is The Nature of The Weightless To Soar)

Inside I am blue.
You are invisible within.
For those watching
you are an elegant dinosaur
I am a blue whale</description></item><item><title>Two Poems</title><link>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p269/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:40:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.evalapply.org/tblm-public/posts/2015/02/p269/</guid><description>**ADDING AND SUBTRACTING
**
I always loved math, but was terrible at it. Even now, when I see cars coming towards me, it reminds me of these feelings and how I am glad I have them, and then sorry to have them, and then happy, and how there are two cars coming towards me, then three, now four, and I am fifty four, then five years old, then six, then seven, and soon eight, and there is one sun in the sky, it’s so beautiful, and then zero.</description></item></channel></rss>
