<h2>Two Poems – by Arjun Rajendran</h2>
<p>**Hotel Lobby: Sultanahmet Istanbul<br>
**<br>
After the mosque and the church, some chestnuts,<br>
after the rain— every drop a passport<br>
to misery— we return to a room not housekept.<br>
As we wait, we’re offered Turkish tea and Apple tea.<br>
The family next to us is, we learn, from Germany.<br>
Well, they’re Iraqis from Germany. We’re Indians<br>
from America. But this evening, we’re all in the lobby<br>
of a hotel in Sultanahmet: united against<br>
the weather, armed with tea, conversing about<br>
our adopted lands, kvetching about the cost<br>
of food in this tourist district, how to bargain for lamps,<br>
the cheat who drove us from Taksim, why they will<br>
never return to Baghdad; sharing snippets from our lives<br>
to keep the windy evening outside our thoughts,<br>
from gripping our bones with visited sorrows<br>
till we only remember places we’re here to forget.</p>
<ul>

<p>**Four Segments, Five Recurrences<br>
**<br>
1</p>
<p>A stranger is showing me his poetry collection-I’m envious it’s thicker<br>
than mine. The book is a folio of medical records, prescriptions,<br>
x-rays and a photo of a poem written as a healing exercise.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>My grandma just died and I’m in mourning. My father, the atheist,<br>
is telling me not to worry. Points to her rice colored footprints<br>
made overnight on his office floor: see, she’s still here.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The second round of a job interview. Scientists pass by smiling<br>
ever so politely. I’m specifically told not to sit in view<br>
of the camera as their shareholders shouldn’t know they are<br>
hiring immigrants. I’m tense. Nobody’s asking me questions.<br>
What’s the plan for today? I ask. Today we sit<br>
back and relax, watch some porn.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I’m talking in French with a Bonbon girl in Paris. I think je voudrais<br>
will sound better than je veut. It turns out the girl is actually<br>
from England. Embarrassed, I order some Bonbons in English.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>I’m in an open area. The air thick with metals smelting. Blue<br>
tanks line the walls. To each tank, one child, covered<br>
up to the neck in hot water. The children are<br>
screaming “ow, ow, ow”. What’s happening??? I ask. Someone<br>
replies it’s to increase the chemo’s efficacy.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>I ask the Bonbon girl when she’s getting off work. The women<br>
around her snigger. We realize neither of us is single. Agree<br>
there’s no harm in a fling.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>In the last tank, a boy of eight. He’s breathing comfortably<br>
at the bottom and playing Mahjong. I pull out<br>
my cell phone surreptitiously, click his pic. I dream<br>
of the likes I’ll get in that photography forum.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>I’m pretending not be hurt by his disinterest toward my collection</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Two queues of workers in construction hats; I have the job<br>
and it begins with me sitting on a concrete block<br>
between sick children in tanks and mutes looking past me.</p>
